I had gone past this restaurant so many times and thought ummm meh because I have to admit it's not so welcoming looking from the outside. I also peered through the windows at night whilst passing in the car a couple of times and thought nah! Then I saw the reviews on yelp and thought seriously?\n\nHaving joined the yelp community and met some of the reviewers I thought...Yes seriously this must be good. So I took my little cold to try out something spicy.\n\nWell we only ordered three dishes, I would have liked to have gone all Asian but I would have needed the stomach of a cow with it's four chambers to get through it all... on that subject you can indeed order stomach, trotters, tripe and the like should you so wish. We ordered Sichuan Style Tofu, Peking styled fried pork with pancakes and the Pork, shrimp, egg and vegetable dumplings. \n\nThe dumplings were a good size and tasty. The tofu was firm and had a lovely spice to it, just right to unblock my nose! The pork wrapped in pancakes was delicious too. Portions are generous and we were really quite stuffed. Thankfully my friend knows me quite well and stopped me ordering by the third dish otherwise I would still be there eating now! I liked this place very much and will return to try other dishes. But my main mission will be to find people who have a stomach for the more adventurous side of the menu. Really want to try their intestines, hope it's like how my father used to make them. So many dishes to try! Just happy this place is so nearby and to think I have been searching for so long! \n\nPrices are a little on the steep side but I have to come to terms with that when it comes to Chinese food unless you get a greasy noodle box from some public transport station, but that is a whole different ball game!\n\nOh I should also mention they have an impressive selection of craft beers too!"""

And so here in Berlin, I am glad to have found this.\n\nOne tip: if you ever try and eat here, don\'t order from the menu that has no pictures. Order from the menu that has pictures. The picture-less menu is your standard Chinese fare that you would expect every Chinese restaurant would carry. But the menu with the pictures, those are the bomb!\n\nWe ordered three dishes which we shared between the two of us. We ordered the beef tripe (D03), the seaweed salad (D12), and the pork belly stewed in tomatoes with glass noodles (D33).

We went for the cold potato salad and the squid for starters, both excellent. For mains we had some steamed fish and fried sweet and sour pork.

Eventually we settled on a chicken and a pork dish (I don't remember the names because they were Chinese!) and some pork & shrimp dim sum.  Both of our dishes were awesome!

b'da-jia-le-berlin-3',5,b'2015-02-15',"b""Wow, I did not expect this at all. First, best Chinese food (non-dim sum category) I've found in Europe. Spicy, tasty, and a diverse selection of dishes that go way beyond the typical Asia Box imbiss menu of X with noodles, Y with noodles, X with rice, Y with rice, etc. The menu is divided into two parts -- the first includes pictures of each dish and is mehr oder weniger the best part. Lots going on here, with a wide variety of Chinese regional cooking, and even some (Russian, Indian) borrowed from neighboring countries. The second half of the menu is the more traditional set of Chinese dishes you'd expect to find in a Chinese restaurant anywhere in the West. We tried beef with cumin spice, a whole fish with five-spice flavored sauce, szechuan pepper flavored shoestring potatoes (very spicy!), and a spicy cucumber salad. Service was nice and helpful, and while I little spartan, the restaurant was clean. \n\nSo, we'd have been pretty with all of that, but then, wow again, somehow this modest little chinese restaurant just happens to have the best, most affordable, and most diverse craft beer selection in Berlin!  Really. A few American imports, Belgians, and German microbrews.  Flat German pilsners are rarely good matches for spicy food, and wheat beers and rice are a poor match as well, which is why I was so geeked to see hoppy and flavorable beers on the menu here that could stand up to chili peppers and other strong spices.\n\nWe were less than halfway through our meal and already trying to figure out how soon we could come back without it being awkward."""

Their soups and stews are hearty and perfect for Berlin's awful winters. Kimchi lovers you may have a religious experience. Warning: their Szechuan dishes are properly spiced (very, very, spicy). I'm a regular and with every visit am discovering new flavors. In my opinion this is one of Berlin's most interesting restaurants. My only complaint is they don't currently take credit cards."""

But hell, they deserve the business. \n\nOccupying a space that was once an industrial laundry, and decorated a bit like a suburban hotel lobby, Da Jia Le is very much the opposite of a trendy hipster hangout. Whatever. It's all about the food. Order off the menu of Northeastern Chinese regional specialties (the section with the photos), many of which are unlike anything else you'll find in Berlin. The spicy dishes are not only truly, properly spicy - they're wonderfully fragrant and well-balanced, with very generous portions. The Sichuan Pork in Chili Broth is probably my favorite, and one order (13.50) is big enough for several people. The meat menu doesn't shy away from offal and bones (the stuff of real Chinese food) and the vegetable and tofu dishes are sensational too, especially the eggplant. \n\nEvery time I've been, the service was incredibly friendly and professional, making the experience all the nicer.

b'peking-ente-berlin-2',4,b'2011-10-15',"b'Outside of Vietnamese and sushi, Asian food in Berlin is often disappointing.  So when I came across glowing reviews for this restaurant on another site frequented by Germans I was cautiously hopeful - even though it is located in the middle of tourist-trap hell.\n\nThankfully that optimism held true.  The SO and I shared a Sichaun Menu for 2 that included Fried Prawns, deep fried duck, Gong Bau Chicken, and baked pork in sweet and sour sauce - all for 32 euro.  On the whole the food was very good, with the strongest dish being the chicken, which was fresh and nicely sauced, and the weakest being the pork, which was the only dish we did not finish.  But even the pork was better than average, with a sauce that was not the usual sweet goop too often found in Chinese restaurants but rather a more complicated citrusy one that allowed the pork room of its own to be tasted.\n\nIt should be noted that the SO and I both agreed that we enjoyed the meal, but would not have that particular menu again.  So why the four stars?  Well at least one of the stars is for the tea we drank.  They have a selection of more exotic Chinese teas available by the pot - we had Jasmine flower-ball (which is literally a Jasmine flower inside a clear pot - cool and tasty) and green-tea with roasted rice which is really excellent - almost a more masculine tea that comes across as somewhat smokey and yes, a bit ricey (in a good way!)\n\nThis is a restaurant I will return to because the menu holds a great deal of promise.  The dim sum choices, for example, look above average and they offer a Chinese fondue that sounds excellent.  When I go back, however, I will not make the same mistake we did tonight, arriving without reservations to a packed restaurant.  We were lucky we got in as they turned a number of larger parties away out-right.  Clearly Berliners have discovered this and I am glad I finally stumbled onto it as well...'"

It was raining, (Berlin in July!  got to love it) and this place is right across from Pergamon so it won.  The idea of having late afternoon dim sum sounded good.  However, as I\'ve come to learn dim sum in Germany does not mean the same thing as in Hong Kong or the states.  Basically, they had 4 or 5 different dumplings you can order, but not traditional dim sum with a variety of small bites.  That is fine, just something to know up front if you are expecting little carts rolling around with lovely treats on them or a menu of small bites and some tea.  \n\nWe ened up getting a ""mixed sampler"" of dumplings plus a sea food lemon grass soup.  The sampler of dumplings had 2 dumplings of four different types.  To be honest, only the veggie one was memorable.  The rest were fine, but nothing special, but again I have high standards when it comes to dumplings and such, but lets say I wasn\'t impressed.  The soup however was very good.  It was spicy, the seafood was excellent, and it was almost like a laksa.  I would vote this soup as a good hangover cure or jet lag cure.  A bowl of spicy good things.  IT was actually perfect for a raining afternoon.  This soup is what is getting them closer to four stars in my book.  \n\nSo I would give this place another try and try out a few other things but I was not impressed with how the duck looked.

Lecker Song was everything I had hoped for in decent authentic Chinese dumplings. A tiny place, tucked away on Schliemannstra\xc3\x9fe, I am glad I found this place and finally got to try it out. There\'s a large selection of meat and vegetarian dumplings. The meat ones consist mostly of classics such as Har Gau, Shu Mai, Xiao Long Bao and Wo Tie (pot stickers). The vegetarian ones, however, had more creative flavours. Being ravenous on a Friday night, we ordered a massive selection, including the vegetarian curried pumpkin dumplings. These were mouth wateringly more-ish and tasty, having a samosa-like flavour to them. A completely unexpected hit. Would definitely recommend trying that one out. The Har Gau were also one of our favourites that night. Now this dumpling is a Dim Sum classic. Simply put, it\'s a prawn and bamboo shoot dumpling with ""crystal"" translucent skin made of rice flour. I\'ve had many a Har Gau in my time and it is easy to get wrong. Often the skin is too heavy, cloying and just a nuisance to eat with chopsticks! For this dumpling, it is all about the texture of the filling.  The prawn filling should be ""crunchy"", with bite to it. Some restaurants will put too much cornflour and other ingredients in it to thin it out. For me, Lecker Song got it right on both counts.

I was expecting that Yumcha would mix a little of traditional Chinese ""small eats"" with some western ingredients. And they did that very nicely with the cold jellyfish salad. It\'s got the crunch and freshness I\'d associate with the classic Chinese dish, but more strongly seasoned with sesame and chili. I\'d recommend that if you\'re not squeamish about jellyfish. \n\nHowever, I did not like their dumplings. I was pretty disappointed with all the hot dishes I ordered which included the Shanghai dumpling, nuo mi ji (chicken and rice in lotus leaf), pan fried shrimp dumpling, and shu mai.

It makes no sense to serve pan fried dumplings in the same plate as bokchoi with sauce. The sauce seeps under the dumplings and makes the the crispy bottom all soggy! *cry* \n\nThe shanghai dumplings were a very poor imitation of what they could have been (inspired by the Shanghainese xiao long bao). Again, wrappers are too thick. And they really should have spoons available for the shanghai dumplings because the whole idea is to catch all the tasty soup that\'s inside them. \n\nThe shumai was so-so. Maybe just the red lighting inside making the pork look particularly dark and unappetizing.

I had the duck dumplings and a tall glass of hot tea. Next time I would get the Shanghai with the broth inside. \n\nThe billowing steam from the kitchen makes for a very Blade Runneresque experience, especially if it's a rainy night.

It's not super-flashy-ultra-modern-Asian kind of sleek, but it is sleek-ish and comfortable. \n\nThe service is, well, spotty. But, they were busy, and I gather this place does not thrive on a reputation for top-notch service.

b'yumcha-heroes-berlin',2,b'2014-07-23',"b""Cool name, I wish I'd come up with it! The food, however, remains something to be desired. They do predominantly Asian-fusion dumplings, so don't be fooled by the name that they do full on authentic dim sum. I have yet to find a place in Berlin that does to be honest. I found the pricing a bit steep for what they are, so opted for a set menu at lunch time, which was ok. The dumplings, coloured according to the filling, have a thick cloying dough.  Black for beef, bright pink for lamb, white for chicken and green for veggie. In my opinion, they did not look at all appetising. I get why they have coloured them so, for easy identification when they're all being boiled/steamed in one pot. It just gave a kinda mass produced vibe to it. No refinement. And if you're a true dim sum fan, you'd know what I mean. The only redeeming thing was the xiao long bao, for the uninitiated, these are pork dumplings with broth in them, usually served with a vinaigrette dip. These were fantastic and authentic. If you're looking for a fun lunch option in Mitte then worth a try but there are so many other options I'd rather go for."""

Way too big, so they are unmanageable and fall apart.  The dough is too thick and, again, lets them fall apart too easily.  And the filling is overspiced and greasy.\n\nThird, the service sucks.

b'yumcha-heroes-berlin',4,b'2011-05-01',"b""I've noticed this little place many a time, and remarked (often to myself) that its sleek exterior and savory dumpling offerings seemed promising. Well, today, I proved myself right.\n\nWe stopped in for lunch today, and seated ourselves at the pretty long wooden tables outside. Our server was a really sweet girl, and offered us menus in English. Although I'm getting better in German, it's always nice to have an option--especially so I don't have to translate every menu item for my non-Deutsch-speaking man. Yumcha Heroes has an array of daily specials, and they are proud to serve food without preservatives or any unnatural ingredients. And you can really tell--everything we had was fresh, untainted by artificiality, and thereby truly delicious.\n\nWe went with the daily special edamame--soybeans steamed and sprinkled with sea salt--which were hot and moist and perfectly tender. The sea salt was nice, and although the grains seemed sort of large at first, they continued to melt a bit and added just the right amount of saltiness. We also ordered the Shanghai dumplings (which always come steamed) and the beef dumplings with onion and ginger (which you can order steamed or fried crispy in the pan). Unfortunately, I ordered my beef dumplings steamed, but our waitress brought them out crispy. Hmm--well, no matter, I decided not to say anything, they still looked fantastic, and they were! The beef was incredibly tender, seasoned perfectly, and the accompanying dipping sauces (hot chili, soy-vinegar, and plum sauce) were a tasty addition to the already delicious flavor of the dumpling. The Shanghai dumplings were better, though, with a little bit more spice and a bit of soup in the middle! Comparing steamed to crispy, I'd say the steamed dough of the dumplings is yummier than the pan-fried. But that's just my opinion. Ooh and the crispy dumplings came with boiled bok choi with a bit of soy sauce on it. Mmmmmm. SO GOOD!\n\nOnly complaints? Our food seemed to take forever. I don't know if it's because they hand-make each set of dumplings to order--which is awesome if they do--but patience is not one of my favored virtues. Also, as mentioned, I wanted steamed dumplings but got fried. The little things, you know? Also, know that if you are super-starving, one order of dumplings for your is NOT going to do it. Order 2 for yourself, and maybe a third. \n\nI will most definitely be back to (hopefully) upgrade Yumcha Heroes to five pretty stars."""

Here you go to pick whatever you like and as much as you can, but the stuffs at Lucky Star serve for you but always make you wait for long time and bring just a little no matter how many people you have, so I will definitely suggest you to come here rather there.'"

The chicken was well cooked the spicy was balanced the coconut sauce was not covering everything like sometimes happens with this kitchen type; the duck crispy and the side dish was made up of vegetables and a little sweet sauce\n\nI think the fortune of this place at the moment is the a capable chef.

b'rice-queen-berlin',5,b'2015-11-21',"b""Absolutely loved this place. First off, we were sat right away, which is a good start. We did come on a Saturday, and it was fairly busy. I love that you have the option of ordering smaller, sample sized portions. It gives you the opportunity to try multiple dishes if you can't decide on what you want. We decided to start with Gado Gado, and (two) fried pork dumplings. This was my first time trying Gado Gado, and though I am not usually a fan of tofu, I really enjoyed it! And for only 3 Euros, it was definitely worth it. The dumplings were also great. I liked that they were pan friend, rather than deep fried. For mains, we ordered the Peanut Duck and the Lime Chicken. Both were delicious. Good presentation as well. My one complaint would be that the duck was slightly overcooked, which made it a bit chewy.  \n\nOverall, the food was very tasty. Service was fast and friendly. Price is very reasonable. I am excited to go back, and next time, try a couple more dishes out."""

b'rice-queen-berlin',1,b'2016-06-24',"b""This place is terrible. Why did I believe the yelp reviews? The food is not fresh nor good quality and is masked in pre-mixed sauces, over fried in old oil and served in small cheap portions - reflecting the quality. The chicken looked as though it was breed on hormones and pumped with water and starch. I don't usually bother to write bad reviews but I feel stupid for going here and want to warn others against it. Tourist trap. Bad."""
b'rice-queen-berlin',4,b'2013-07-09',"b""Given the name of this restaurant, I am sure that plenty of people have come here to have a juvenile moment. Anyway, my companion and I tried this one evening, and we were pleasantly surprised. After all, I have this idea that as Berlin has plenty of Asian restaurants, it cannot be the case that all of them are good. So perhaps there are more bad restaurants than good ones. This is coming from someone who is still surprised to see Thai and Vietnamese and Japanese cuisine in one roof.\n\nAnyway, like I said, our food was rather good. And given the price, I expected something bare-bones, but what we got were rather swanky. I ordered the Sumatra duck, and it was said to be rather spicy. Beware of the red chilli peppers; they really are hot. My companion ordered the spicy duck, which was more a hot and sour sauce. Both came with rice. And we washed it both with iced ginger tea. \n\nOverall, I think it was a good choice. I'd be more than willing to go back here again when I have the chance."""

I like that in the menu, they specify what is in all of the sauces they use, since usually in an Indonesian or similar restaurant, I am not too familiar with the types of sauces they have. Other than that, I didn't think this restaurant offered anything too unique. The food was just ok and will do if you are craving Indonesian food. Service was again, just ok. The atmosphere was comfortable, but I honestly am not that convinced to come back again."""

I love how this restaurant is busy but the good kind where you can still hear your own conversations and don't have to wait long for food\n\nFood: We ordered the nasi goreng and 2 small dishes and a side of plain rice. The nasi goreng came as a massive serving and it tasted great and authentic. There is this section at the back of the menu, where instead of ordering large mains, you can try mini versions of them to try a variety of dishes. I ordered the spicy fish which was not really spicy but delicious. The fish fillets were fried!! The second dish was chicken with sumatra sauce which is a coconut milk sauce with spices. They were very filling! \n\nDrinks: A large variety but I ordered a pot of Jasmine which was perfect.\n\nPrice: I don't know the exact price but it was definitely worth it. The mini versions of main dishes were about $2.90 each?

b'selig-berlin',5,b'2014-06-05',"b""A friend suggested an impromptu lunch and fancied something Asian, so I had to leave my comfort zone and venture out of Sch\xc3\xb6neberg!  It had been a while since I was at Selig, which specialises  in Hunan, Sichuan and Lanzhou cuisine so for a brief moment I thought they had changed hands, the interior was completely different, where was the Aquarium, would I get my dumplings or hand pulled beef noodles? \n\nTurns out Selig had just upped its game and gone all funky. Newly refurbished; actually it's still ongoing Daniel was just mounting up some of the old pictures to hang on the new walls. The toilets are all modern and tiled with Mah-jong pieces, very trendy! I really liked the alcove at the back made up of Abacuses or should one call them Abaci Who knows! \n\nI had gone there intentionally for some homemade Jiaozi and Lanzhou Salad or perhaps a bowl of beef noodles. But the new d\xc3\xa9cor steered me off course and I ended up having something else instead. They say everything happens for a reason and rightly so as I left feeling a whole lot more Asian than when I went in (I recently took a survey to determine my subconscious true nationality, the outcome was German.)!\n\nAnyway, shortly after we ordered our drinks we were presented with a complimentary appetiser of cucumber dressed in a slightly spicy sesame sauce. Amazes me how something so simple can taste so good.  We perused the menu and settled on #012 Fr\xc3\xbchlingsente (crispy fried duck with Lanzhou salad and a peanut sauce), #013 Fritiert Tintenfish (deep fried salt and pepper squid) and #162 Dir Rauber von Hunan (Hunan spicy fried beef) .\n\nThe Lanzhou salad that came with the duck was how I remembered it. I just love the taste and textures, all mingled together in a delicious and slightly spicy dressing.  The Spicy beef was delicious, packed with fresh green chillies, garlic shoots, red peppers and coriander. It was fragrant and had a nice dry heat.  \n\nMy only disappointment was the squid. I expected pieces of fried squid in a salt and pepper coating but it was actually more like battered calamari rings, without the salt and pepper, having said that it was really tender. I soon got over it as Daniel the manager had added a complimentary fish dish to our surprise. This was really, really good and off menu, Carp in a chilli sauce, a speciality from his province. Seriously, the fish just melted into your mouth and the sauce was to die for!  I was quite happy just to have the sauce with the rice it was that good. \n\nMy lunch companion said the Chinese food here made a very good impression on him; Chinese is not usually his first choice when it comes to Asian food in Berlin. Something I tend to agree with!\n\nThe whole meal including a beer and a pot of green tea came to about \xe2\x82\xac27. \nWill come back again soon for my Jiaozi fix, or maybe I will have the beef noodles mmm... Watch this space!"""

The Szechuan fish we ordered tasted like old frozen fish, very stale and slimy in texture. \n\nOverall sanitation of the space was turnoff to my wanting to eat anything there. Would not recommend especially given the price of usually 20-35 a person.'"
b'selig-berlin',5,b'2013-10-20',"b""My companion took me here for dinner one night. I am not a big fan of Chinese food, but he said I might change my mind after this one, so we ventured into Charlottenburg for this little restaurant.\n\nAs I was browsing the menu, I noticed that they specialize in Lanzhou cuisine: this already earns them 1 star, as I'd rather go to a place that has a narrow specialization and does it well, than a place that has a wide specialization and does everything mediocre. China is a huge country, and I'd rather go to a restaurant that would introduce me to a more specific type of cuisine.\n\nThe second and third star is for its food quality. They seem to have a lot of noodle-based dishes (maybe it's a Lanzhou thing, I don't know), but everything we ordered was fabulous. My companion is a vegetarian, but the things we ordered tasted something I didn't expect for vegetarian food. Glass noodles, deep-fried crunchy tofu, that was mind-blowing. \n\nThe fourth star is for the ambiance and atmosphere. It was clean, funky, modern, but at the same time, also rather traditional. I like the juxtaposition of the old Chinese-style furniture with the pop-art interior design. \n\nThe fifth and final star is for the fact that as much as I would like to find something bad, I cannot. Maybe their restrooms need a little bit of remodeling, but I am so willing to overlook that since their food is just delicious, and cheap too. Their entrees average around 8 EUR, and 12 EUR is high-end already. \n\nNeedless to say, I am definitely going back here. This is good Lanzhou cooking; it gets full points from me."""
