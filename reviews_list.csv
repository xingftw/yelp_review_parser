jing-yang-berlin,5,2017-10-22,"Hard to find good authentic Chinese food in the area that are willing to make the food as spicy as we would like it to be. 

The owner was quick to help us order the correct amount of spice and the woman cooking in the back was responsive to the spice level. Normally, Germans do not like much spice in their food. Rest assured if you ask for spicy food, you will get it. 

Really enjoyed the variety of food available. 4 different items, 3 drinks for 50€ is a good meal. We will be back!"
jing-yang-berlin,5,2017-10-11,"Best Chinese food I've ever had! No English menus but the waitress was beyond helpful. I actually ate here on my one night alone while my husband was at a work conference, and enjoyed every bite of my solo dining experience!"
jing-yang-berlin,5,2017-07-01,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant by far. Their food is excellent - I have never had a dish I didn't like - and the staff is friendly and helpful. If you happen to be in the area around lunch time, try one of their soups (with fresh, homemade noodles!). The dishes can get quite spicy, but you can always ask beforehand if you're not sure."
jing-yang-berlin,5,2016-09-17,"I haven't been to China, but this is what I picture as more of (from what I've seen on TV and from how friends describe it) as more authentic Chinese cuisine. Small place, very quaint but nice. My wife and brother in law had a chicken dish with green veggies (mostly onions and Lima beans, IIRC). It was very light in flavor, but in a good way. They both really liked it. I had a hot broth dish with some really great chili spices, beef, potatoes, and veggies. It had some real kick to it, but was pretty great. They served a family pot of white rice to eat everything with. Ended up being a little over €10 per person I think. We will definitely be back here to try more dishes, strongly recommend."
jing-yang-berlin,5,2016-04-18,"This place is perfectly authentic! It's a small tidy restaurant, the dishes are so delicious and the price is reasonable. You can ask for recommendations and you won't be disappointed!"
chi-chi-kan-berlin,5,2016-03-21,The food is exceptional and the service quick/friendly.   We ordered vegetarian food and left quite satisfied.  The prices are quite reasonable.  Be sure to get a reservation on peak nights as the restaurant is usually very busy.
chi-chi-kan-berlin,5,2016-01-16,"A place I could easily visit daily! The food is exceptional , the staff are more than friendly and talkative too! Happy to speak in English as well as German .  I feel extremely welcomed and more than satisfied when I leave . A massive thank you"
feedback-berlin-5,5,2017-09-30,"very delicious! especially all kinds of local Cantonese style DIM-SUM, which stands out among other chinese restaurant~"
feedback-berlin-5,5,2016-02-25,"Like just : AMAZING ! 
once you go there ...you'll just wish /want to move to Berlin just to be able to try all dishes EVERY DAY !
on top of being delicious they are decorated in such an exquisite and elegant way that can only assure you ""you won't be disappointed""
hope you will all enjoy as much as i did. definitely recommendable! 
service is super sweet, the place has a great decoration, all is very clean
my best advise is : GO ! GO ! GO!  TRY! TRY!"
feedback-berlin-5,5,2017-07-06,"Visiting from New York City  for only five days and was lucky enough to be brought to this exquisite restaurant by my friend Jake. Better than any of the restaurants back home - freshest flavors and most delicious combinations I've encountered. Tofu has never tasted so good - whether quickly deep fried or sautéed or smoked. Shumai and wontons were perfect and light and wasabi shrimp out of this world.  And how can a humble cucumber salad be that amazing?
Gracious service; beautiful outdoor setting, lovely bottle of Albariño and above all scrumptious food. A must."
feedback-berlin-5,3,2016-12-09,"Nothing special. It's pretty much your average Chinese place, but a bit more expensive. The dim sum is better than the Hauptgerichte."
feedback-berlin-5,1,2016-04-02,"Really confused by the reviews and I am not even a foodie.  I had their version of Kung Po chicken and it was almost inedible and the dish was about 50% oyster sauce with very little meat.  They do have a nice outdoor eating area if you just want to have a beer, but I would stay away from the food if you are remotely used to real Chinese food."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2015-10-24,"After living in Taiwan for a while a few years ago, I always missed it's food and especially beef noodle soups. This is as close as it gets, in a very authentic small restaurant with great prices. 

If you want Taiwanese food, this is the place for you."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2017-11-05,"Listen up people. Shits about to get real. This place, Lon Mens, is a temple. A temple of flavour. 

Chilli wan tans, is what you need to order. 

Trust me. Now did you really think that with all this flavour, you wouldnt get some sort of attitude? Come on man, dont ever play yourself! The man of the house (lil older dude) had gotten a lil crankey over the years, so if you get treated like shit, dont trip - its part of the experience. Apart from that, and that this place is always packed, this is one of the greatest places everyone and no one knows about. If you reading this, then congratulations. You just got the bestest berlin tip ever my fren. They dont come often, and they usually aren't free. But ey, its ya lucky day. Now go pack your shit, go grab your wife and kids, leave the dog at home and get the fuck over there. Do something for your health, dont be a lonely man and come on down to Lon-Mens. Peace n love,
Ya neighbour hood man
Peng. C"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,3,2017-10-11,"I was here earlier for dinner, and I must say I wasn't too impressed.

We were early enough to not stand up and wait for a table. We ordered noodle soups and some dim sum as well as pig ears. Nothing life altering. Slightly overhyped even, I must say. The noodles were just okay, and I had better noodles before. Perhaps I am biased with ramen, but the noodles here had a flat uni-dimensional taste. And the dim sum and pig ears were also just ordinary.

I know other Chinese places that have more interesting items on the menu. So I don't think I'd be back here again, unless this is the only open option.

Oh, the air circulation inside could be improved."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,3,2017-10-19,"Not bad, not great. Portions of non soups small and a bit pricey. Not overly flavorful. Busy but fast and friendly service."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2017-10-15,It was a pleasant surprise to find this very authentic noodle shop in Berlin.  I ordered the beef noodle soup and spicy wontons.  Both were very good.
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,3,2017-02-22,"We came because we heard this was the best dim sum joint in town -it was good, but not life altering. We had chicken soup, the combination dumplings, the house fried dumplings, and peanut sesame noodles. The soup was delicious and the star of the show -moist chicken and a flavorful Thai broth, the combination dumplings were good, but 5€ for 4 small dumplings was steep. The house dumplings were very delicious -very flavorful. The price on these was a little better (10 dumplings for 8€) -but still quite expensive. The peanut sesame noodles were good -they were served a little tepid. I would've preferred them served hot, cold, or at least warm. Overall, the food was good, but expensive for the portions and I've had better. The customer service was great. We were seated and served quickly. The food was made fresh from the kitchen, viewable from the dining room."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2017-01-28,"Incredible fried dumplings and very tasty beef, duck and pork knuckle noodles. 
The restaurant is small and there are usually big lines but it is worth the wait. It is also very clean."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,3,2016-05-18,"I read quite alot good review about this place before I actually got here. Although the Noodle House is facing the main steet, my partner and I did drove pass it. And have to check the house number to find the place. The shop is actually not so big. so better keep your eyes on their shop sign or the house number, if you on the way.

I have been looking forward to pay a visit for quite a long time, until recently finally got the chance for this. So as soon as we sat down, we were just looking for something nice from the meun. Of course, I ordered noodle soups with beef and fried noodle with beed as well. The soup one I think was alright. Probably, because I knew some other great noodle soup places. I really like the Fired noodle, it tasted very fine and delicated. Also we order XiaoLong Dao as side dish. it tasted good as well, but the potion was just small for us.

This place isn't self-service. It took a small while the staff came to us. The price of the place is great."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2017-04-11,"If looking for an Asian cuisine with attention to quality, it's a good place. Prices are reasonable. The space for guests is limited, but it matches the prices. (Google translator)"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2016-02-09,"Good taiwanese noodles place in Berlin. The beef brisket noodles 牛肉面 were good but the broth could be a bit more flavorful. The beef cut was so yummy tho!

We also got xiaolongbao which was ok. The skins were a bit too thick but they arent a xiaolongbao 小笼包 specialist so what we had was already acceptable. The dimsum combo (with hagaw 虾饺 and siumai 烧卖) was not that good though. 

Super cheap price and generous portion. Plus, super friendly service. The place is a bit small and might get a bit crowded during peak hours."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2016-11-27,"Delicious chilli dumplings, tasty noodle soups! Great prices and even if there is a line, it goes fast and is worth the wait! Heard about this place on vice channels ""chefs night out"" and since I'm obsessed with noodle soups, HAD to take a break from all the döner and come when I was visiting Berlin."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,3,2016-06-26,"I was in town for a conference but since the conference center (CityCube Berlin) offered very few options for food, I decided to look for other lunch options accessible by transit. I found this Taiwanese restaurant with great Yelp reviews, only three train stops from CityCube, so I decided to give it a try. Since I grew up eating Taiwanese food and was just recently in Taiwan, my expectations were quite high. I ordered a small beef noodle soup (recommended by other Yelpers), xiao long bao (XLB), and shrimp dumplings. Although it was a treat to even have the options to eat Taiwanese food in Berlin, I was unfortunately not impressed by the food. XLB had no soup (isn't that the whole point of eating XLB??), the texture of the shrimp dumping skin was too sticky that it was impossible to pick them up without breaking them open, and the beef noodle soup didn't have Taiwanese flavor. I probably would have enjoyed the dishes more if I wasn't expecting authentic Taiwanese food... Other than that everything else was good- nice, friendly staff who can communicate in English, easy to get to by public transit, and reasonably priced meals. I would recommend eating here only if the expectation is to not have authentic Taiwanese food, because objectively they are relatively good, just not Taiwanese in my opinion."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2017-04-03,A place for comfort food and authentic Taiwanese noodles. The workers are very friendly and service is fast. It's quite a small place though so you might have to queue up a bit during peak hours.
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,1,2016-10-03,"Visit Berlin hoping to get a nice experience of Taiwanese food. The man at the restaurant is so rude, I feel so silly even bothered going to his restaurant."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2017-01-18,A tiny place with usually long queue. But food is cheap and tasty. Their 'chilly oil dumpling' is must try.
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2014-11-26,"I read the reviews and since it is in our neighborhood, we went to check it out. I have never tried Taiwanese food, so I do no have anything to compare it with. The waiter was very friendly and patient enough to explain us some dishes. I ordered a large portion of their specialty soup with beef for 6.50 EUR. It is a large bowl with vegetables, noodles, beef and a good tasting broth. The prices are decent and I will have to come back for other dishes.

The ambiance is nice and simple. The staff is friendly, attentive and helpful. The place has approx. 10 tables (more or less) and the small restaurant is clean and comfortable. 

I will go back again to learn more about Taiwanese food."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2016-04-09,"This was my 4th visit to Lon Men's and this time Dim Sum only. Nice sunny spring day and we were lucky to snatch a table outside. The duck bun should be listed as ""heavenly dream"". I had a foodgasm. Sure, this place is super busy because of the excellent food. I live in Neukoelln but happily trek on out to Charlottenburg, knowing I'm gonna be in heaven once again."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2015-10-20,"Delicious Taiwanese food!   I love the noodle soup with a side of crispy duck.  My son loves the chicken drumstick noodle soup...I mean, all are delicious.  I'm sure I'll be spending many a cold winter day here..  Appetizers such as xiao long bao soup dumplings were also great...honestly:  just go.  Now."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2016-06-04,"It is great Place for a fast meal. 
It's very small but all original handmade food. 
Everybody have to try this food."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2016-06-14,"I was in town for two weeks on a solo trip and this joint was one of the few Chinese / Taiwanese places that seemed noteworthy, especially given that they actually sell 牛肉麵. That said, I was slightly miffed that their 牛肉麵 seemed to follow the Mainland tradition of the dish; I was pretty hyped up about the prospect of eating a Taiwanese-styled 牛肉麵. The 小籠包 was okay, but overall the place is priced really well. If you're feeling like you want some good Chinese food while in Berlin, be sure to stop by!"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2014-11-14,"As a Taiwanese-American, I was elated to find Taiwanese food in Berlin. I'm a pretty tough critic, but overall I enjoyed my experience at Lon-Men which brought me back to typical Taiwanese restaurants in California or Taiwan.

Starting from the best, the beef noodle soup was very good, lots of heat (you'll be sweating), with tender beef, the noodles were a bit flimsy for me but that could be personal preference. The pork chop with dry noodles were good, chili oil wontons just ok IMHO (I have a high standard, few places ever get it right), and gua bao was disappointing, lacking on filling and flavors (go to Street Food Thursday/Bao Kitchen).

Despite my criticisms, I will definitely go back to try more dishes, I'm still just happy I can find Taiwanese food in Berlin! Plus the staff is friendly :)"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2015-11-06,"I had never had been one for soups for dinner and was quite skeptical about it, but with the more than pleasant reviews on Yelp I decided to give it a try. Thank GOD I did. This was wonderful. The waiters are wonderful and helpful. And the noodle soup with crispy duck was phenomenal. Also the dim sum was clearly made by the gods."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2015-10-29,"What is better than a bowl of piping hot soup noodle on a chilly autumn day? Nothing, that's what! Pair it with some pot stickers or steamed dumplings and my life is completed. This hole-in-the-wall place has truly authentic Taiwanese soup noodle and dumplings. Everything we had was delicious. The owner was super nice too. It can get a little crowded at lunch time, thou, but that all add to the experience I think. I felt like I was in a Taiwanese night market noodle shop. :D"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2014-11-18,"Great little Taiwanese restaurant on kantstr. It feels really authentic. Started with wontons with chile oil - amazing and duck bun appetizer - a little dry and falls apart as you eat. We asked the owner/waiter for recommendations on other dishes and without realizing exactly what we ordered, both ended up with the noodle soup with beef slices. Lost in translation, oh well. It was very good but not enough to order again.

Also ordered the Taiwanese maultaschen/dumplings with pork filling. They were excellent, somewhat similar to the wontons. They had tsing tao beer and krombacher, the first was kind of flat and the latter was good but no beer on tap that night, too bad.

Overall a great experience - just know you're going to a hole-in-the-wall restaurant with good food but nothing fancy and you might come out smelling like you spent a day in the kitchen. Phew!"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2015-06-24,"One billion times yes!

While living in Berlin I ate here at least twice a week. During the heat of the summer the inside seating area can get pretty toasty, and that my friends, is the only downside. This place has the most amazing food. I still dream about the chili wonton and the duck bao. 

I am salivating just thinking about it. 

I never had a dish that I did not like and the owner was so kind. Also, I never had any problems speaking english here so don't be shy, there will be no Germanic eye-rolling here."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2016-02-15,"Amazing little Taiwanese restaurant with the best dumplings that I have ever tasted.  I grew up going to Wo Hops on Mott Street in Chinatown, NYC, and this hole in the wall rivals how much I loved that place.  Everything is cooked fresh in the tiny open kitchen in the front and there are a few tables in the back.  Probably not the place to go for a larger group.  The chili dumplings are addictive and all the noodle dishes were great.They have an English speaking server and the service is as soon as the dish is ready, which means you may get your main course before your appetizer.  Good portions, cheap prices, and you can get it to go (takeaway).  Don't miss this one!"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2015-08-12,"As a part Taiwanese transplant I was happy to find this place, and even happier to try the food. The beef noodles here were good, although I can't say they are what I would expect from Taiwanese beef noodles based on California and Taiwan experiences. But very happy to have it and will return for the beef noodles, as close to a home feeling I can get in Berlin. The ""dim sum"" sampler was perfectly acceptable, but you would be disappointed if you're used to California dim sum."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2014-08-20,"One of my favourite places to eat some noodle soup and dim sum. I don't know where to start: the food is amazing, the owners are adorable and funny,  the price is more than fair. I really like it to bring friends here who haven't tried dim sum yet. Go for the ha cao ones (with shrimp filling) they are the best!"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2016-02-02,"Tiny little place , looks like a takeaway place but you can sit there. Just by the look of the place one would underestimate it. But say it Berlin style or Taiwan street style, the food is authentic and yummy.The duck bao, the dumplings and the soups really pleases your taste buds."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,3,2016-10-26,It was a busy place. Had to wait 20 minutes for a table. Had the beef noodles and spicy wonton. Food was just okay. Taste was in the mediocre side and portions were small. I have had better noodles in Berlin. I had high expectations based on the reviews but I think this place is overrated.
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,3,2015-10-02,"Beef noodle soup is quite good especially the meat, but the noodle could be better! Side dish marinated beef tastes good as well and won ton in chili sauce also recommended!"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2015-07-20,"If yelp had half stars, this would be a 4.5. Prices were fair and everything tasted delicious. If you were thinking about getting the wonton in chili, you must get it! My girlfriend and I devoured them before our soup came. We ordered #7 and #12 soup and ate every last bite; perfect meal after a plane ride. It felt like I was in Chinatown eating some legit Chinese food"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2015-07-14,Very authentic Taiwanese cuisine. Tiny intimate place   with great snack food. Nice and fast service. I had the duck wraps and wantans and they were just delicious!
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2014-10-13,"I ate noodle soup once here in 2011. The taste was so so. Maybe my choice didn't meet my expectation.
A week ago I had sudden craving for noodle soup. A colleague of mine suggested this place again, saying that a lot of taiwanese eat here and I should try beef noodle soup.
OK, so I went there and ordered for 2:

- Pork ear: Tasted good. I love the sauce, it's just that it was so thinly sliced and there were more cucumber than pork ear
- Duck bun: Was OK as appetizer
- Guotie (dumpling/gyoza in japanese): Was OK
- Beef noodle soup: Was delicious. I love the broth. The broth wasn't as thick as ramen broth, which I normally prefer, but it was tasty!
- Wantan noodle soup: The noodle and soup were also tasty but wantan was so so."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,3,2014-09-12,"This noodle house in Charlottenburg has a lot of competition in the form of elegant looking restaurants all over the street. Yet this low-budget Taiwanese restaurant stands its ground, it is frequently visited and recommended quite often. A food blogger like me now has the duty of finding out why.
I had a good seat on the street and ordered a noddle beef soup. In short, it lacked a little bit of flavour in my opinion. Sure, I could make up for it with soy sauce and these super spicy red sauces that you find in every chinese restaurant. Yet, something was missing. I cannot name anything particular, it was just the overall image. But I didn't want to sound too harsh, it is still a good choice. And what I want to underline is the fact that a little too less flavor is still hundred times better than artificial flavor. I think you agree with me, at least on that regard

lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2015-10-29,Really authentic place with great noodle soup and dumplings. Incredibly nice owners. Tastes just like in Taiwan!
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,1,2014-07-26,"I ordered duck with vegetables and noodles, it was a REALLY small portion and there were no veggies except lettuce, i was expecting way more form that place than what I got. My boyfriend got beef noodle soup and wasn't satisfied with either.
In comparison to other asian places, you don't get enough food for the price."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2015-08-19,"Real food, no bullshit! Often very busy, but its worth the wait ( chairs line up outside, so u can sit an wait for a free table) friendly staff, very laid back atmosphere. Good homemade food for really good prices. Soup was awsome, dim sum was awsome!"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2014-10-22,This is the best (by far) and most fairly priced Taiwanese/Chinese noodle/soup place in Berlin. I've tried many others and this place remains my number one choice. You will see why when you see the gigantic pots where the broth simmers for hours for the right consistency. Great choice during Berlin's unfriendly winters (but I go there in summer too!).
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,1,2016-10-16,"I am extremely disappointed with the food & service tonight. First of all, the old men who took our order was pretty rude. I asked what the difference is between the no.2 & 15. Anyhow, he raised his voice and cut me off completely. Then I said to myself:""some places which serve awesome food just don't give a f&$k on the service side, maybe the food will make up for the poor service "". NO! That didn't happen. My boyfriend had so called Taiwanese beef noodle soup. The broth taste like water mixed with a bit of soy sauce, beef slice has not much flavor plus they were chewy. I ordered the crispy duck with dry noodles. Duck was nice but balance isn't quite right in the sauce. Oh we also ordered the wonton in chilli oil - again weird sauce. Last but not least we also ordered the buns. Omg... this is probably one of the worst meals I have ever had. I also have serious doubts whether this so called Taiwanese restaurant is run by Taiwanese..."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2015-04-22,Awesome place with perhaps the best snd most interesting food on the affordable level. Try the dumplings or a soup!
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2013-09-18,"Amazing authentic Chinese cuisine. Had the pork knuckle noodle soup, roast duck dumplings and roast duck bun. So delicious I can't stop thinking about this establishment . Now I  am in Miami longing for more. When in Berlin you must try this Noodle House."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2013-01-05,"After more than a week of European food, this was ALL I wanted in Berlin! The place was tiny, but the service was fast and friendly. Our noodles came quickly and had piping hot tasty broth with plenty of beef slices. I wish the noodles themselves were a bit thicker, but really, that's just being nitpicking, especially considering how cheap they were."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,2,2015-08-12,"Having sampled similar fare in Taiwan, mainland China, and Southern California's San Gabriel Valley, I have to report that Lon-Men's Taiwan-style noodle shop is not all that great. We had a pork-chop rice place, marinated-beef rice plate, fried dumplings, and vegetables. The dumplings were the best, but none of these dishes was special. The interior was hot as Hades (sidewalk tables were filled up), and the staff and owner tried to make the two of us move from a roomy table for 4 to a tiny table for 2--very annoying when there were many empty tables in the place, and when two other tables for 4 were occupied by lone diners (we declined to move but promised to do so if the place filled up, which it didn't). No reason to return, especially with other Chinese restaurants on the street looking more promising."
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2013-11-05,"Disclaimers: i am chinese, but fam is from HK so my preferences tend to lie in canto food. 

if you order exactly this: 1. Crispy duck buns 2. spicy wontons 3. beef noodle soup you will love this place! 

Tried the soup dumplings - they are just dumplings, no soup like traditional XLB has. small size soup was perf for me, the bf also had the small size, and he's a large german, so with the small soup + dim sum bits, you're good and about to be very full!"
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,5,2014-09-07,I stumbled upon this hole in the wall the other day. Seriously great place given the low prices and great tasting food. Try the noodles with seame and peanut oil. It's seriously delicious!  The hot and sour soup was great as well. Can't wait to go back!
lon-mens-noodle-house-berlin,4,2011-07-27,"have eaten there about ten timesalways very good food.everything except the spring rolls, which taste JUST LIKE the frozen ones you buy at all the Asian markets here, which is shocking considering the dishes are so delicious.but everything else if very good!!! and the service is very nice tooi'm glad its not so close to my house or i would be eating there every single day cause its also very inexpensive!!"
lecker-song-berlin,5,2015-07-03,"In a word - best dim sum I have ever had in my life, even better than in China!

Longer version (for the brave) - hands down, best dim sum I've had so far.

We've arrived here for dinner before it got really crowded, so if you plan on coming here after 20:00- reserve a table, the place is pretty small.

Once we've opened the menu we were thinking ""ok, so what do we not order?!""
As my friend is vegetarian, we had about 9 options to choose from if you exclude the ones with chicken/pork/seafood.
Which is quite a lot! 

So we've settled on four, all vegetarian.
The one who took our order asked if we're vegan or vegetarian, we said no but didn't really understood why - until he put complimentary prawn crackers on the table, super nice and highly considerate! 

For a starter we had a soup that was kind of tasteless until we added some soy into it, but as the dim sum arrived we forget about it.

9 - kakao traum, absolute best! If we weren't full after all the food we'd totally order one more round of those, perfect flavor, perfect serving.

The others we've taken were also really good, but this was really something else.
From our point of view this is a place you can't really go wrong.
There's no good and bad, just tasty and tastier!"
lecker-song-berlin,3,2016-03-02,"Hmmm apart from the very cute utensils and the super cute dessert baozi (one with chocolate in panda shape and one with strawberry jam in piggy shape) the other dimsums are average at best.

Ha gaw and dumpling are most likely frozen ones from the supermarket with super thick wrappings. The filling is tasty but the wrap just kills the merit of the filling. XLB is very disappointing :("
lecker-song-berlin,4,2017-05-25,"My first experience with Dim Sum. I can't vouch for authenticity, but it was definitely delicious.
Go early or reserve ahead. Space is limited"
lecker-song-berlin,5,2016-07-10,"Tried it out if curiosity. I got a salad (cucumber) and  dumplings. I loved both. They have so many kinds of dumplings. I tried a couple and have fallen in love with this place. Situated in a charming street , I think the only restaurant I'm this side of the Street, this place has a lot to offer. Definitely worth checking out."
lecker-song-berlin,2,2016-05-02,"Worst dim sum ever.. Yes.. I got suckered in as I saw the miss piggy dessert pictures on other reviews. The miss piggy dessert was nothing but bread with artificial strawberry jam in it. The rest of the dim sum was subpar compared to any other authentic Chinese venue. I ordered the typical dishes shi jin bao, cha shao bao, dumplings with vegetables, glass noodles, and carrots, and xiao long bao. It just didn't taste fresh at all. 
Our server was nice and attentive. She gets 2 star for that. End of story. I don't know how this place has so many stars."
lecker-song-berlin,5,2015-05-15,"Oh my goodness - AMAZING DUMPLING AND GREAT SERVICE!

Came her around 5 a couple days ago expecting to wait for a table (based on the other yelp reviews) but we were quickly seated and given cushions and a nice table spread to make sitting outside more comfortable. The waiter and waitress were very sweet and attentive and our food came out in a timely manner! The prawn crackers they serve before your meal are delightful. 

The dumplings were delicious and ask for the sweet chili sauce! It's really nice with the shrimp dumplings. The green tea is served in a nice porcelain detailed painted tea pot with adorable little cups. 

And every dumpling plate is €4.90... What could be better!

Wasn't a huge fan of the dessert chocolate bear dumplings but it was good to try. Can't wait to go back!"
lecker-song-berlin,5,2016-10-26,"I wanted to try this place for some tjme and finally made it! Wonderful place for dumplings! Cheap, tasty, fast and a great service! It's a small cute shop in a nice area, the tea is super special. The menu is small but I find it a good thing. Their specialty is the dim sum. They have also quite a few options for vegetarians and vegans. Absolutely love it."
lecker-song-berlin,1,2016-07-30,"The 3 color(dish no. F4 Sanse) is the one I like the most! Good service, nice stuff but the food taste not surprising, not really recommend... I feel sorry"
lecker-song-berlin,5,2016-06-15,"so, SO good. amazing prices (we drank and ate until we were stuffed, for under 25 euros). small restaurant and cash only as far as i can tell, but i would come here every day if i could. most importantly, EXCEPTIONAL service (which is a rare find)."
lecker-song-berlin,5,2014-06-03,"I've always been a fan of dim sum. It's like heaven in your mouth. So when an opportunity presented itself to go to this place, I immediately took it. A companion was visiting town, so when we needed to have dinner, I suggested this place and made a reservation.

They don't have an extensive menu. They have two soup types, a handful of cold salads and other appetizers, about 5 vegetarian dim sum, and about 8 meat-filled dim sum. But that was enough to bring heaven to the inside of my mouth. 

My companion and I each ordered a soup, and I tried the wantan soup, which was delicate in its flavor and presentation. The wantans were floating in warm soupy bliss. It had just the right taste, and was meant more to enjoy and savor, than to simply slurp.

Then my companion and I ordered three different dim sum to share. With perhaps the most expensive order still being under 5 EUR, this wasn't an expensive meal. Each order have 5 pieces of dim sum, presented inside a steamer, and yes, they provide wooden non-disposable chopsticks. They also ask you what kind of sauce you want, as they have several choices at your disposal. 

Oh, the shao mai, and the shrimp-filled steamed mini buns, they were all heaven in my mouth. Next time, I'd go down the menu and try the other items.

I'll definitely be back. This is a great find, and is something that will be on the top of my list for a while. Reservations are recommended, as they are a very small place, with only a few tables inside."
lecker-song-berlin,5,2016-06-08,"Not the best dim sum I've ever had, but it was still really good. The price was fair and the waitress was really sweet and on the ball. The other woman working there was also really nice as well. Definitely coming back."
lecker-song-berlin,4,2015-09-20,"I love dim sum- it's my absolute favorite. This place was absolutely delicious, and they have some very unusual kinds. They have an entire selection of vegan/vegetarian dumplings, really adorable dessert buns, and unusual and flavorful sides.

The place is pretty small, but it has a nice homey atmosphere.  I'd recommend arriving before the peak dinner hours, or making a reservation. However, if they don't have any open tables, they also take your number and give you a call when one opens up, so you can explore the Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood in the meantime."
lecker-song-berlin,5,2016-01-11,"So so so good. Loved the wonton soup and the rice wrapper pork dumplings! The perfect place for a quiet, low-key, delicious meal."
lecker-song-berlin,1,2015-11-10,"Edit May 2017: 2 years ago I visited the place and rated it with 5 stars.
Today I'm giving it just one star because the dumplings taste like supermarket frozen ones.
I expected fresh dumplings that are not teaming with preservatifs but there you go. Not gonna find that here."
lecker-song-berlin,3,2016-07-02,"This is a cozy cute place. Offers mostly a small portion with about 4 tiny one bite size (no bigger than McNugget size) dumplings costs 4.5-5 Euro average/per plate. I would not consider this to be exactly cheap. If you are hungry and sharing, you would probably want to order about 3-4 plates each person. I do not have a size of cow stomach and I am a tiny woman. Do the math. Should not be listed as €. More like €€€ for what it is."
lecker-song-berlin,5,2016-09-30,Amazing place to experience authentic chinese dumplings while also being able to eat fully vegan if you want to! Everything vegan on the menu is deliciou and the staff is really nice!
lecker-song-berlin,5,2015-06-25,Excellent handmade dumplings and fast service. The dumplings didn't feel greasy to eat and everything feels authentic. The price is not cheap (we each paid 10 euros per head for lunch) and we're still hungry. You pay around 4-5 euros per dumpling order (usually 4 or 5 pieces). But very authentic experience.
lecker-song-berlin,5,2015-01-23,"We already ate at Lecker Song a lot of times since this little restaurant with just a few tables opened . 
It's always very good, always very fresh. Everything is homemade, original and tasty.
You're always warmly welcome, both the owner and the staff are very friendly.
A good place, to recommend."
lecker-song-berlin,5,2015-11-07,Amazing dumplings and friendly service. This is the best dim sum I've had in Berlin. Their tea selection is also amazing.
lecker-song-berlin,4,2016-02-10,"Yum yum yum!! I came here on a Wednesday night based on the reviews and was not disappointed! I ordered four sets of dumplings, then liked them so much that I ordered more. I ended up trying all six different meat dumplings, and they were all fantastic. I would have to say that the shrimp and the chicken were my favorites, though I unfortunately can't report on their extensive vegan and vegetarian options as I was all about the meat this evening, but I hope to go back soon and try them. Staff was friendly and attentive without being pushy. Thanks for the great evening!!"
lecker-song-berlin,4,2014-11-24,This little and tiny restaurant is hidden just behind Helmholtzplatz. The first time I tried to find it I almost passed it. Once you enter you are being welcomed by the friendly owner who offers you one of the very few buy cozy tables. They have various dumplings with many different fillings and tastes. I always just order a few and then more along the way. In that way you can spend a good and relaxed time with friends here. Food tastes solid but there is still a bit  room for improvement. It's pretty pricey as well but overall better than all the places along Kantstrasse. Certainly worth a try. But rather don't come in large groups.
lecker-song-berlin,5,2015-03-05,"This place is awesome.  We tried different types of dumplings, including sweet ones for dessert. We did not regret a single one.  I recommend making a reservation as the place has 5/6 small tables and fills up quickly. I also recommend eating something before as you will need a ton of dumplings to make a whole meal, and while the portion costs between 4/6€, it adds up.  Kudos to the homemade shrimp chips you get as a free starter and very friendly staff. I will be coming back soon."
lecker-song-berlin,5,2016-03-29,"All the homemade dumplings are so oriental and delicious, finally some different choices for chinese dishes other than rice and noodles:) i will definately visit again!"
lecker-song-berlin,5,2014-09-09,"one of the best dim sum place around the city, small and cozy restaurant with homemade dim sum menu and a dim sum vegetarian menu available too.

personally I loved the chicken and coriander one, so tasty!

will go back there for sure"
lecker-song-berlin,5,2015-08-11,Probably the best dim sum in PBerg -- service is very attentive and kind.
lecker-song-berlin,5,2015-06-03,A fantastic place for vegetarians. A whole page full of veg dumplings and I also recommend the spicy cucumber salad. People says it's busy so consider going a Wednesday night. It's an easy tram ride from Mitte and a good excuse for checking out Prenzlauer.
lecker-song-berlin,5,2015-03-12,"This is place is truly amazing. The dim sum is incredible and the staff is very friendly. We had some seaweed salad that was quite delicious. Even the sweet dim sum for dessert were quite good. I plan on coming back very very soon. I highly recommend this place. I suggest making a reservation though, it fills up quickly and while the food comes quickly, people don't eat thaat quickly, so you might have to wait."
lecker-song-berlin,5,2015-06-06,"Here I go, adding my five stars to the constellation of raves. This place is a MUST whether you're veg or not. My boyfriend and I, vegetarians from DC, went there on our last night in Berlin and would have gone back every night if we'd had more time. Prenzlauer is a cool neighborhood, and this place is a gem. Decorated in a quirky, colorful style, it features astonishingly good dumplings and a cucumber salad you'll taste in your dreams. Everything is prepared with care and an eye toward color and texture, and the staff are friendly. The only possible improvement would be an array of specially prepared dipping sauces for the dumplings. The chili-infused oil simply isn't flavorful or distinctive enough for the venue. The sauce coating the cucumber salad, however, is a delight. This place is well worth going out of your way for."
lecker-song-berlin,5,2014-09-12,"If you are looking for a dumpling fix in Berlin, then look no further!! There's no need to go to Ming's or Kantstraße! Lecker Song was everything I had hoped for in decent authentic Chinese dumplings. A tiny place, tucked away on Schliemannstraße, I am glad I found this place and finally got to try it out. There's a large selection of meat and vegetarian dumplings. The meat ones consist mostly of classics such as Har Gau, Shu Mai, Xiao Long Bao and Wo Tie (pot stickers). The vegetarian ones, however, had more creative flavours. Being ravenous on a Friday night, we ordered a massive selection, including the vegetarian curried pumpkin dumplings. These were mouth wateringly more-ish and tasty, having a samosa-like flavour to them. A completely unexpected hit. Would definitely recommend trying that one out. The Har Gau were also one of our favourites that night. Now this dumpling is a Dim Sum classic. Simply put, it's a prawn and bamboo shoot dumpling with ""crystal"" translucent skin made of rice flour. I've had many a Har Gau in my time and it is easy to get wrong. Often the skin is too heavy, cloying and just a nuisance to eat with chopsticks! For this dumpling, it is all about the texture of the filling.  The prawn filling should be ""crunchy"", with bite to it. Some restaurants will put too much cornflour and other ingredients in it to thin it out. For me, Lecker Song got it right on both counts. A must try when you order! Will definitely be returning and ordering everything on the menu! ;)"
lecker-song-berlin,5,2013-08-27,"Fantastic service! Nice small area with outdoor seating. Smoked tofu was possibly the best tofu I've ever had. The Shao Mai and Fen Guo were awesome as well!  For dessert, the Zongsi. I hope to return while I'm here."
lecker-song-berlin,5,2014-08-26,"Wonderful dim sum.  TONS of vegan and vegetarian options.  I highly recommend the tofu-shiitake dumplings: wonderfully seasoned, delicately sweet, with meaty tofu.  We also had the zucchini-rice noodle-morel dumplings and the tofu-morel-pea dumplings, which were also delightfully flavorful, hearty, and comforting.  The pickled cabbage appetizer was like slightly sweet kimchi and was delicious; the smoked tofu and bell pepper appetizer was also wonderful, with very high-quality bell peppers, extra-firm smoky tofu and lots of fresh herbs.  We also loved the red-bean bun dessert.    The place is tiny and feels like a mom-and-pop restaurant:  the atmosphere is cute but not fancy.  The waitstaff were helpful and attentive. Best Chinese food I've had in Berlin."
lucky-star-berlin,5,2015-05-23,"GREAT FOOD! I've been here twice this week, once because I needed soup for a stupid cold. Twice, because the soup was amazing! 

Get the wan-tan suppe with pork. It's bursting with delicious wan-tans stuffed with minced pork and scallions, fresh veggies, and yummy broth. 

The restaurant can be a little empty early on, but ignore it because the food is SO GOOD. The service is fast and friendly.  I hope to come back one more time before the end of this trip, to try the spicy vermicelli noodles with pork."
lucky-star-berlin,3,2016-11-09,"We had a craving for hot pot, so we crossed our fingers and looked for the closest place in Berlin. Lo and behold, it was less than 0.3km away so we tried it and were incredibly satisfied when we left.

We tried the spicy and Chinese herbal soup bases, and thought it tasted slightly bland and not as spicy. However, we satisfied by how cheap it was for all-you-can-eat (13.50€ per person). The downside was that water and tea were extra charge. 

The downside was some of the meat wasn't as fresh as we had hoped. The tripe and prawns looked dodgy so we opted for vegetables and beef, which were fine."
lucky-star-berlin,2,2017-02-01,"Fairly good food and experience, service was friendly. My duck was tasty. Unfortunately I woke up at about 2am with MSG head-ache and didn't get back to sleep for the rest of the night. They do mention that they use MSG in their menu, however if you're not used to eating I'd recommend staying well-clear of this place, because they obviously apply it by the truckload. Otherwise, if you're immune to the effects of MSG, I heartily recommend it."
lucky-star-berlin,4,2017-01-18,"If you feel like warming a frozen body with a yummy hot pot, this is a great place. They have an unlimited all your can eat hotpot deal. It's definitely worth money."
lucky-star-berlin,3,2016-12-04,"People seem to come here for the hot pot. We ordered from the menu and were deeply disappointed. Being Chinese myself i have high standards for Chinese cuisine and low tolerance for dishes seasoned with supermarket oyster sauce and the like. The sauce for the mapo tofu was definitely out of a can, and the sauce for the garlic eggplant as well. The dumplings were good but frozen industrial. This does not apply for the quality of hot pot, which I have not tried."
lucky-star-berlin,4,2016-09-26,"Hot pot is quite ok.  Variety of hot pot dish is not so much, but still quite authentic hot pot! Recommended!"
lucky-star-berlin,4,2016-01-09,"Had the Hot Pot here, it was pretty good.  Menu was pretty good as well.  Have gone back."
lucky-star-berlin,4,2015-05-01,"Been here at least 3 times already. Good interior design, tasty food, friendly staff. Recommeded!"
lucky-star-berlin,4,2015-10-28,Mix dim sum is fresh and tasty. The location is also very good. Very near the U-bahn station.
lucky-star-berlin,3,2012-02-24,"Casual dining, Chinese restaurant located a short walk up the road from the Friedrichstraße rail station in Mitte (~5min walk). 

Menu includes a range of typical Chinese dishes, but the real attraction is their 'hot pot' specials where they set up a simmering pot of soup (you can get the soup as mild or spicy as you like) on a burner in the middle of the table with a variety of seafood, meats, vegetables and noodles to cook at the table. It's the perfect way to warm up on a chilly day! Prices for the hot pot combinations are very reasonable, making this a good value and fun way to share a meal with a group 

I have not tried many of the items from the regular menu, but did order their noodle soup for lunch once - I was not particularly impressed by it. Stick to the hot pot if you feel like a warm soup/noodle type of meal. 

They also have a small range of dim sum that are quite tasty bites. I like making a meal of it by ordering a few different items. Depending on how hungry I am, I can order more or less. My favorite here is the har gaw (steamed shrimp dumpling) with a nice dip in chili sauce before popping into my mouth."
lucky-star-berlin,5,2013-09-29,"OMG, food coma, reminds me of my days in China. Just the variety of sauces and quality of meat a tick below CN level. Actually surprising, but local food is maybe always best."
lucky-star-berlin,5,2012-07-12,"This was an excellent Chinese restaurant we happened upon our last night in Berlin.  Although we each had an entree (mine was actually not Chinese, but rather a curry - don't ask), we'd shared an assortment of dim sum (10 pieces).  They were excellent!  While both of our main courses were good, we'd eaten so many dumplings (and that's what we like the most, anyway), that we would have preferred just sticking with the dim sum for our whole meal.

I also had a mango lassi (I know, also not Chinese), that was very good, though not as good as Zum Moghulhof in Vienna (home of the Best Mango Lassi known to me).

I would definitely return to this restaurant for the dim sum, and the friendly service."
lucky-star-berlin,5,2014-12-11,"I was with a couple of buddies of and we happened to stumble at this AYCE place at Oranienburger Tor.  This place is honestly fantastic; we had heaps of fish, meat and delicious broth. I've gone hot pot hopping in Berlin, and I think this is genuinely one of the best places in Berlin from a hot pot perspective. I would definitely go again with my buddies sometime soon!"
lucky-star-berlin,4,2010-01-24,"Fun place for a group of friends. Pretty authentic Chinese hotpot with choices of soup bases - ranging from mild to very spicy.
Eat as much as you want for a fixed price with a selection of meat/seafood and vegetables. Choices could be better - e.g. different meats, veg etc.
Overall, great value, nice surrounding and fun. Was pretty stuffed at the end of it so make sure you have empty stomach to get the most out of it!"
lucky-star-berlin,4,2008-12-09,"This place does an unbeatable Sichuan hotpot (or steamboat) for 12.80 Euro for all you can eat. The stocks for the steamboat are pretty authentic although I didn't agree with the peanut dipping sauce too much. There are 3 platters that come with the steamboat, a mix of vegetables and noodles, a mix of fish and cow belly (which is much nicer than it sounds) and a meat platter of chicken, pork, beef and lamb. All of that goes into the hot boiling stocks and then you stuff your face as much as you want. Watch out for the dark Sichuan stock - it's apparently a bit too fiery for some people though it was quite tame for me. It all sounds good but after the second round, it gets a bit same-ish and one can end up rather bloated. But it is still a fun night out and a great economical place to take your friends for an unusual dinner!"
lucky-star-berlin,4,2012-09-12,"Was einem am Lucky Star zunächst auffällt ist die tolle Inneneinrichtung mit einer Kombination aus chinesischen Elementen und deutschem Stuck die sehr ansprechend wirkt. Als zweites fallen einem die sehr günstigen Preise auf. Für einen Mittagstisch mit Suppe & Gericht bezahlt man ab 4,90EUR was wirklich sehr günstig ist. Die Suppe (Sauer-Scharf-Suppe) war sehr lecker und auf jeden Fall selbst gemacht da sie sich sowohl farblich als auch geschmacklich von den 08/15-Suppen bei den ganzen Vietnamesen unterscheidet. (Die Besitzer des Restaurants kommen alle aus Südchina.) Das Hauptgericht (Schwein mit Sellerie in Austernsauce) war vielleicht etwas klein. Was aber angesichts der 4,90EUR und der vorhergegangenen Suppe echt in Ordnung ist. Kurz: ein Lokal dass man zum Mittagstisch uneingeschränkt empfehlen kann!"
tianfuzius-berlin,5,2015-10-28,"A vegetarian / vegan Chinese restaurant? What a cool idea. And very well worked out in this case. The food is good to excellent, the decoration is very nice and the service was great, with a young waiter doing an excellent job. You could see that he was loved by the regulars. 

Our favourite dish was the cauliflower, but the rest was also very nice.

Conclusion: Please open a location in Friedrichshain so we can come often!"
tianfuzius-berlin,4,2017-02-15,"Good!! Nice interior and food. I go very often even its quite far from my place. They have menu ""suan la tang 酸辣汤"", its good who loves hot spicy food but time to time its bad... ask for more spicy ver. If u  wanna try gooood suan la tang."
tianfuzius-berlin,4,2016-02-09,"We were lazy last night, so instead of cooking, we opted to find some place near our neighborhood to eat. We stumbled upon this place, even though we were walking on our way to some other location, which, perhaps fortunately, had no place for us. So we walked into this one, asked if they had a free table, and voila, we were seated within minutes.

This restaurant is affiliated with the restaurant in our own neighborhood, Tian Fu, and since we knew that was a good choice, I had high hopes for this one. After all, this is quite adventurous: vegetarian and Szechuan. 

Given that there was a vegetarian constraint in this restaurant, I was impressed with the tasty selections they had. There was a section of the menu where they had alternatives: fake duck, fake meat, and so forth, but even if you don't go there, there are plenty of interesting items one can order. 

I simply loved the eggplant Yiuxiang-style. We also ordered a bunch of other appetizers (we're those snobby types that think that appetizers are more interesting than main dishes), and since there were quite a bit of eggplant, we opted to take the remainder home.

I am withholding a star for logistic reasons: there is a section of the restaurant that can only be reached by climbing the stairs. While we were there, someone tripped, and almost crashed on to another table. It would have been great if they installed handrails, or at least made the steps a little bit more visible. The current paint job of very creamy beige doesn't make it too obvious, and people might miscalculate their steps.

Otherwise, this place is great. I'll definitely be back."
tianfuzius-berlin,5,2015-03-07,"What a fantastic restaurant. Great service, the food just out of this world. We got treated by the charming owner to a plateful of vegan calamari. OMG! Just amazing. This place is a must try for all you vegetarians/ vegans and spicy food lovers."
tianfuzius-berlin,5,2016-11-02,"Dear Tianfuzius, Please come to Prenzlauer Berg! We trekked all the way from Prenzlauer Berg to eat here, and boy were we glad we did! We had Xiao Long Bao (Chinese steamed buns), Gebackene Wan Tan mit einer süß-sauren Sauce (fried Wan Tans with sweet and sour sauce), Tofutopf nach Sichuan-Art (Spicy Sichuan Tofu Stew) and Vegetarisches Gongbao Huhn mit Erdnüssen (Vegetarian Gungbao\Kung Po Chicken with peanuts) - every item was delicious to outstanding! My non-vegetarian friend loved the dim sum more than anything and I savoured every interestingly different tasting bite of the tofu stew that left my taste buds in awe! The dim sum portions were small but the entrees were big, especially the stew! The service was nice and the restaurant interiors were lovely. Prices are fair for the quality of the food, portion sizes and location. I highly recommend it!"
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2015-10-21,"This is a massive operation; right across the Chinese embassy. On a Wednesday evening, it was packed, with both Chinese and non-Chinese diners inside. There were plenty of Chinese diners; that for me was a good sign.

We decided to stick to ordering little things, and avoiding the main dishes. By the way, the main dishes are huge, so bring an appetite in case you want to order one of those (they come with rice). We ordered the 1000-year-old eggs (we liked it so much we ordered a second one), the spicy tripe, steamed dimsum with pork and vegetables, as well as small servings of the shark fin soup, as well as the sea cucumber soup. We also ordered a pair of non-alcoholic cocktails, simply because their juices looked interesting enough.

Oh, the millennium eggs were great! It looked disgusting, but it melts in your mouth. I loved it. I haven't had it here in Berlin, until now. I was missing it, so it was time to feast on it. 

The spicy tripe was also a great dish. It was not too hot, in my opinion, although I remember them marketing it as rather hot. I guess it's not Szechuan cuisine. Regardless, I loved it.

And finally, the dimsum, which was heavenly.

The soups were interesting, but I should say that the shark fin soup had more hype than taste. I can't say I hate it, but I am not a fan. I guess it is just popular because of its ingredients, but I didn't really see why people make a big deal of it. In my opinion, I found the sea cucumber soup tastier.

Overall, I had a good experience here. I would definitely come back again."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,3,2017-06-03,"It's a reasonably nice place, the waiters were friendly, no problems, the food was... ok. Not great, but ok. The buffet is pretty small and lacks some more sauces (if you offer duck, fish, etc. by itself, I expect more sauces to go with it than just sweet&sour). One meat (I think it was beef) was only lukewarm at best and pretty chewy, which was also true for some of the other stuff. Personally, I would not recommand the buffet, but we will probably go again and try something from the menu."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,2,2015-12-26,People say that it's the best Chinese restaurant in Berlin but I think it might be a bit overrated. There is a big selection of food. Even the most fancy things like shark fins. The menu is very authentic. My boyfriend and I (both from China) decided to have some daily food though. We had Dan Dan Mian (sichuan noodle) and sauer sweet fish. The portion of the sauer sweet fish was not very big. It tastes okay but not so amazing. The noodle was too soft and it was just a bowl of noodle. There should be more meat. The kiwi alcohol free cocktail was disgusting. The staff was friendly though. And the price was okay. Maybe I will try the all you can eat or the more fancy stuff some other day.
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2014-07-06,"One of the best Chinease Restaurants in Berlin. They have a huge selection of dishes on the menu, way more that you will find in a lot of other places. The menu is really Chinease with a lot of ""exotic"" dishes like pigs ears, intestines, chicken feet etc. We had some starters and some meat dishes. The portions are really generous and the meat dishes come with rice. I will certainly go back there, great find. 
The location is also nice, you can sit outside and have a direct view on the Spree."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2016-06-08,The buffet is huge and full if interesting stuff... Very good for 15 euros..Some of the food are slightly customized to western tastes so that bit is irritating... The dumplings are fresh and tasty...Everything else is quite good and authentic.
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,2,2014-08-21,"I'm Chinese and the food here is awful. The Beef dish was too salty. 
We also got the duck pancake, wow the pancake they used was soggy and not the correct one I rate that ""F"" Bad Bad. 
Close to Potsdamer Platz there is a GOOD duck pancake place Pek-Ente or something.
Dim sum nothing special. Overall, I will NOT return."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2012-04-22,"Real chinese restaurant across the street of the Chinese Embassy. Once, when  I was invited to the 60. Anniversary of the Republic of China Act in the Embassy, this restaurant was the caterer. God food, some of them so authentic, that you are warned by the staff. I highly recommend this restaurant"
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,2,2012-07-08,"I gave 2 stars mainly because of the Unfriendly Waiter who made me feel sorry about asking anything,
I assume he's the son of the owner. Unfriendly and somehow rude.
Food is Ok, a bit on the pricey side considering the quality of the food:
We got Half Duck which was good, but the sauce was far too acid.
Rice was good.
Vegetables were ok, but not worthy of 8EUR.
Won ton soup with prawns is too expensive, 5,80EUR for a very small portion,
and taste too much like sesame sauce. 
I tried many chinese restaurants and this one is not gonna be on my list,
def. i won't go back to eat here."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2014-04-12,"This place is amazing! The location is very easy to get to, and the menus have ENGLISH! The english menu made the restaurant quite welcoming and put us at ease when ordering. 

The food itself is quite good, and the service is reasonable by Berlin/European standards."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2013-07-04,Authentic Sichuan cuisine. One of the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to when I'm abroad.
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2012-12-30,"The mixed review from this restaurant is probably because of its originality and Non Asians, who are used to the cheap Asian noodles around the corner.

The food is typical food of the zhejiang province. They don't do dim sums, so I didn't bother ordering dim sum. I have been here a couple of times already. If you want to experience original zhejiang cooking this is the place and order from the menu. I've tried the buffet, but the quality is not the same."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,2,2012-07-07,"Standing proudly just across from the Chinese Embassy I expected a great deal from this Restaurant. The food was mediocre, the restaurant looks reasonable nice and it's relatively clean. Although I got a dirty knife and a dirty look for asking for a replacement knife. The Mapo Tofu was not like any I'd seen before in my life and there was about 9 grains of mince in the sauce which I know because they were so few I could count them. They have a wide selection of Dim Sum and I had a selection, I was only really satisfied with one of the selections the others tasted like rubber (probably because they were using rubber in the steamers) . I have, unfortunately, no Idea where they got the good reputation they are supposed to have."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2013-07-14,It's hard to find good authentic Chinese Food outside of China.  This place is awesome.
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2012-03-03,"fantastic food. huge selection from many Chinese regions and perfectly done. especially interesting is the dim sum selection  i cant seem to have enough of those and find myself coming back again and again.
the prices are moderate (45EUR for a couple) and the service is very professional.
on Sunday there is a buffet that is boring and not recommended."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2011-08-12,"I've been to the Ming Dynasty I several times, every visit has been a success, good food and good service. The highlight was the the Feuertopf (hot pot) which I shared with a friend one Christmas Eve. Lovely sauces and generous amounts of food. They top up everything as much as required, even the prawns which my friend really tucked into. The tofu was the freshest and the best I can remember having and it was the first time I had the sliced noodles. The peanut/chilii sauce is to die for.
I have also had the buffet for Sunday lunch. This is very good (and good value as well), if not as much a gourmet experience as the hot pot. A good selection of noodles, meat dishes,fish, spring rolls and even some sushi. In particular I enjoyed the crispy duck and the fried prawns/shrimps. The food is continually topped up so things don't run out, even the popular items.
Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in town!"
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2011-02-05,"Great dim sum,tasty wantons(i really love the fried one),to mantion the fried chicken with shenchuan pepper::is a twice fried chicken meet with skin,covered with a mountain of dry chilly.the dish havo no sauce at all and it's very spice.The desserts are bit boring,the usual banana frittes,and ice creams.
Authentic chinese food."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2009-05-29,"Terrific food, with a range of unusual items that one rarely sees in standard Chinese restaurants. No doubt its location right across from the Chinese embassy helps to get the kitchen honest. Certainly worth a visit."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2008-12-12,"Arguably the best Chinese in town. Good friends is good too and has more roast meats, but Ming Dynasty has a better dim sum and vegetarian menu. The wantons are really really yummy, with a little bit of lemongrass in the stuffing - miam miam. The only negative point is there a very light wine list: there's like 2 reds to choose from and no rosé (which is really de rigueur with Chinese food). Last time I was there I had the 'Great Wall red (produced in China) and it really wasn't that good. The traditional Peking Duck is a must (book 24hrs in advance), as well as the fondue (really popular with their Chinese clientele it seems)."
nin-hao-berlin,4,2011-10-14,"Very tasty and reasonably priced.  Cosy, authentic chinese decor and music.  Very large variety of dishes on the menu, but limited beverage list.  Definitely going back!  Would highly recommend when you are craving some high quality chinese food!"
nin-hao-berlin,3,2016-04-03,"In general, the food tastes fine, not really impressive but fair. If you want to have ""all you can eat"" hot pot, this place actually I feel much better than another one called Lucky Star which is also located in Berlin near U bahn station- Oranienburger Tor. With similar prices, here there are much more choices, I was surprised that they even offer scampi and mussel! Also more vegetables and the most important things is their stuff is much nicer than another. Here you go to pick whatever you like and as much as you can, but the stuffs at Lucky Star serve for you but always make you wait for long time and bring just a little no matter how many people you have, so I will definitely suggest you to come here rather there."
nin-hao-berlin,3,2014-05-13,Can be a Good choice for the chinese cuisine lovers. I ate a kind of noodle and it was OK. Good location and reasonable price by the way.
nin-hao-berlin,3,2011-05-24,"To order their speciality-Hot Pot- is experience and food is good.Interier is not charming and service is slowest I ever experienced( for example when fire at HotPot dies and you would like to call service to make it work again...or even order one more drink) ,but otherwise still nice people and dog friendly place."
cha-for-tee-berlin-5,5,2017-05-24,"This food is delicious! Never heard of such a place before, but was simply walking by as I had to wait an hour for my appointment at the Zullasungstelle down the street. Walked in, met a very friendly staff that recommended me the Beef dumplings, and I also ordered the pumpkin/pea dumplings. I'm literally just through the pumpkin/pea dumplings right now and realized I had to write in Yelp asap about these guys. 

In the picture is the beef dumplings only (b9 on the menu I believe) as I was starving and chomped on the pumpkin/pea set immediately. Highly recommended and I'll be back here even without an appointment at the Zulassungstelle! :-)"
cha-for-tee-berlin-5,4,2017-08-27,"Set in a beautiful part of the Kreuzberg area called Bergmannkiez, this neighborhood eatery provides delicious dumplings and relaxing atmosphere. Whether you decide to sit outside on the street and watch the passers by or inside, you'll surely enjoy anyone of Cha for Tee's broad menu of meat-filled and vegetarian dumplings.

I went with an appetizer of pork wanton soup, which really hit the spot. Later, I hit the pork dumplings with cabbage and coriander. It was quite good--not the best dumplings I've ever had--but definitely satisfying enough and well worth the price.

But the real piece de resistance of the joint is the desert. I got the pastry dumplings (set of two) which came I are with coffee out on the street-side tables.

All and all, it was a perfect way to spend a late Sunday afternoon."
cha-for-tee-berlin-5,3,2017-07-26,"If you are craving dumplings or some semblance of Chinese food, this place is fine. They have a homemade chili oil sauce that I liked. The dan dan mian was tasty, but it lacked the boldness that I am used to. Xiao long bao was a disappointment --flavor was decent, but most of my soup dumplings didn't have soup. Ma la ro was acceptable.

If this is your only option for Chinese, you'll be fine. Good service, nice ambiance and plenty of seating on a quiet street near templehof. It was a very pleasant experience nonetheless. CASH ONLY."
cha-for-tee-berlin-5,4,2017-10-17,"The place is in a very cute area~there are many different kinds of dumplings here, and they are colorful! Good dumplings!"
cha-for-tee-berlin-5,5,2016-11-07,"This place is so cute. And super tasty. We tried the green bean appetizer and several of the vegetarian and pork dumplings. All are highly recommended- especially the green beans. The tea selection was crazy. The only draw-back was that the dumplings take a while to steam. We ordered another round after our first and then one more for dessert and ended up staying quite a while, even for European standards. But the atmosphere is nice so no real complaints here!"
wok-show-berlin,4,2017-08-28,"Really great dumplings here (it seems everyone here orders it). I heard they raised their prices and I did think around €9 is a hefty price for 20 (somewhat small) dumplings but I really did enjoy them and they were very authentic. I also had the kung pao tofu (€10) and it was quite delicious. Overall, the reviews are accurate, I thoroughly enjoyed the food but felt that it was a bit pricey in comparison to other Berlin restaurants."
wok-show-berlin,5,2016-05-17,"CHEAP. Delicious. Diverse. Flavorful. Plentiful. Homemade. Never Frozen. Authentic. Dumpling. Heaven.

2 Thumbs up & a round, happy Tummy!  Enjoy!"
wok-show-berlin,4,2016-05-25,"I had this one on my list for a while already but so far it didn't work out but today was the day... 

I love dumplings! No matter whether it's the russians or the chinese but these were quality. Because I wanted to try them all I asked whether it's possible to try them all and when the waitress said ""yes"" without hesitating I was already in love with this place! The menu offers 20 piece or 40 piece options either boiled or fried. We took a mix of everything with 40 pieces and it's just the perfect amount to not be too full while still get a good idea of all their flavours. I loved it and I highly recommend to get a ""mixed platter"" (not on the menu).
Although I loved every single flavor the ones with salmon did stick out today..."
wok-show-berlin,4,2016-08-06,"When you have a serious good appetite for dumpling and wish to get a dumpling satisfaction at a reasonable price - then Wok Sho is your place. 

20 dumplings (veg/pork/beef/lamb/sea food) for approx 7-8 euro with an option of boiled/fried.

This is coupled with a variety of Chinese dishes and drinks."
wok-show-berlin,3,2016-12-11,This place is very over rated.  We sought it out because we love dumplings and saw good reviews online. We consumed 20 lamb dumplings (below average) and 20 pork dumplings (better but still just average) which we ordered mostly to see if we simply ordered poorly.  I suppose I'd go if I were invited there but I wouldn't go back.  Prices were good at 7.5 Euro for 20 dumplings.  20 dumplings and a beer each will leave you satisfied with enough room for dessert elsewhere.  40 is a lot of dumplings.  One last note - both of our orders were boiled.  Perhaps we should have tried fried dumplings.
wok-show-berlin,3,2016-07-17,"so... the food is really great. Flavourful, rich. The dough could be a little thinner but it's ok. I also like the short menu they have. Unfortunately the service is horrible. We were waiting for them to approach us first to get the menus and then to collect our order for approximately 45 minutes! If it was only depending on me, I would have already left the place, especially that there were only 4 other guests. Another annoying thing was that when we ordered all together 6 plates of dumplings they were serving us only 1-2 plates at a time. I would prefer to be served the whole order at the same time... The prices are also higher than before. Around 7 for 20 cooked sumplings and 8 for the fried ones. I am not sure if I will go back mainly because of the service."
wok-show-berlin,5,2016-04-03,"Their dumplings are to die for. The starters are great too, very authentic. I like their tea selection too. The prices are really good even for Berlin. My husband and I usually order starters + dumplings + tea and eat to our hearts' content and the bill is always around 20 EUR. It's a must for people who love chinese dumplings!"
wok-show-berlin,5,2015-05-17,"These are the best dumplings that I have found so far. You get a huge order for a very good price and they are very tasty. Try the tofu soup or the cold chicken salad with peanut sauce as well. Very aromatic. I think these are the most authentic dumplings in Prenzlauer Berg. I would further recommend Lecker Song if you prefer something more visually interesting. Forget all the hipster places further south, though. They have no idea how to make a great dumpling serving like what you get in this place."
wok-show-berlin,5,2015-07-09,"Just came from it, and yes, sometimes I go all the way from Kreuzberg to Prenzlauer Berg just to eat in there. When I'm in a dumpling mood, oh I love them and They have so many sorts, you can choose, fried or steamed; Let me tell you my favourite one:
Pork and Celery, steamed!

Perfect to go with a group of friends so you can do the full experience as the smaller portion is 20 uni, 40 uni the biggest, so It's good for sharing, combining ingredients and get to know more than just one taste, and they have that wonderful round table with second surface that you can rotate to get someone else's dish ;) friendly people and English speakers. 

Price is just perfect! 
20uni - 6,50€
40uni - 12,50€"
wok-show-berlin,4,2015-12-29,Very authentic food and definitely good for value. Can get quite busy at dinner time but the food definitely worth the long wait
wok-show-berlin,4,2015-02-01,"Fantastic dumplings at a very reasonable price. Pleasant service, a little slow but it can get crowded. I got the fried vegetarian dumplings. Flavorful filling, thin tender wrappers with a great crispy bottom. A number of sauces at the table rounded out the meal."
wok-show-berlin,5,2014-11-23,"If you love dumplings and if you want a lot of them, then this place is heaven for you. They offer dumplings with different fillings and you can order either a small or large plate of each taste. The problem is, everything sounds so yummy that you'll always order way more than you can eat. But that's ok, as it tastes just like in China. In addition, the prices are really fair and the service is mostly friendly."
wok-show-berlin,4,2016-01-02,"The dumplings are real ones, tasty and fresh. I would just wish for a tomato, piece of lettuce or anything colorful as a decoration, because seeing those white dumplings on a white plate without anything else is a bit... sad."
wok-show-berlin,5,2014-12-25,"Very cozy place specialised in Northern China dumpling. LOVE it! We travelled far for this restaurant, it's all worth the efforts! Very friendly staff and huge portion. Authentic taste, I put my Chinese name against is!"
wok-show-berlin,5,2013-02-08,"Dumplings, Dumplings, Dumplings !!! well done, nice fillings and although made for a small pocket.
Walls locking a little bit strange with all those paints, but ok.
TRY it!!"
wok-show-berlin,5,2014-10-15,"Cheap dumplings! And lots of them! Come with a bunch of people, cos it definitely is more economical to order a lot than little. It is very filling."
wok-show-berlin,5,2015-03-05,"Been there yesterday for the first time and it's already one of my favorites. Load of dumplings for every taste, probably 12 different fillings or more, steamed or fried (I had lamb and chinese cabbage, fried, very good, thank you!), and very cheap too. Classic chinese beer. And some other stuff too (I had duck and it was delicious)."
wok-show-berlin,5,2016-01-10,I love this place for the price and the authenticity. The changing exhibition of paintings is entertaining as well. The dumplings are definitely the speciality! Not sure about the other entrees.
wok-show-berlin,5,2013-11-15,"Came here with a friend last Saturday night.  Finally, AUTHENTIC Chinese food in Berlin!

Ordered jasmine tea, 20 cabbage dumplings (steamed), cubed tofu in a delicious sauce (I forget the name) and double pan fried chicken.  Total flavorgasm and I was stuffed afterward!

This place is a must. Be sure to make a reservation, we were rushed out after two hours to make room for people waiting. It was packed."
wok-show-berlin,2,2012-11-11,"Lots of average potstickers for an ok price. They are made fresh, which is nice, but it was hard to distinguish between the three different types that we ordered...and that is sorta gross. 

But, if you get off on giant portions, then here you go. You should check this restaurant out. 

That is to say, if you are the type of guy or gal who would say to themselves, ""I like seeing a serving of 60 of these dumplings on one plate and it makes me happy,"" then you will fall in love with this place. 

On a side note:
Why pay extra for frying? Are you trying to keep all the cheap and poor fat people away?

Also, it seems as if only Asian people eat here."
wok-show-berlin,5,2013-05-12,"WOW! I live at this place- cant get enough of their AMAZING dumplings. The fried are my favorite, but dont be fooled by the word 'fried' as they aren't really fried but pan fried. They are just cooked in a pan on one side, so in total 20 dumplings (a standard serving) has about a teaspoon of oil.
As every one else suggests, stick to the dumplings, everything else on the menu is just to bulk out the menu; basically everything else isn't great
This place has the sweetest dumpling outside of China, the staff are super lovely and friendly and the paintings on the wall are stunning. The artist is a family member with an amazing talent for oil paintings. A homely, family run, unpretentious place with fast service."
wok-show-berlin,5,2014-03-15,"We only had dumplings which were really good. The fried version of the vegeterian dumplings was really good...Not a fancy place at all, service was bad but we will come back for the dumplings! we paid  for 20 pieces for 7.5€, try it!"
wok-show-berlin,5,2013-03-10,"We were perhaps the only non-chinese customers there on a saturday evening and we were very happy to have made a reservation  the place was jumping! This was immediately a very very good sign. 
We were four and ordered wonton soup and a pork appetizer before our large order of 80 dumplings came out. Everything was delicious and the service was fast and efficient. We had heard from others that any other dish on the menu was not worth ordering besides the dumplings. We were not disappointed. I have made Chinese dumplings myself as well as eaten the best in NY's chinatown. While these are not better than fresh homemade dumplings at my house, this is a great find in Berlin. 
Notice: I only concentrate on the quality of the food. Atmosphere and service usually don't play a huge role in my reviews, unless someone was downright rude, behaved inappropriately or cleanliness was an issue."
wok-show-berlin,2,2012-01-02,"Several people recommended this place to me since we moved to Prenzlauerberg about 2 months ago. They told me that the dumplings are really nice, which I can't confirm. I am a big dumplings fan, and I bet anybody who tasted dumplings in China, wouldn't like the dumplings at Wok Show that much.
They tasted like my own made at home dumplings. The skin is too thick. Also they have really weird pictures on the wall!"
wok-show-berlin,5,2014-11-18,Great place for dumplings. Great price. I recommend the pork and zucchini. They tasted better than the pork and cabbage. Mutton also doesn't taste that great. It was a little gamey. I also recommend pan-fried over boiled.
wok-show-berlin,4,2012-10-11,Good dumplings and good soup. Good quality and quantity for a low price.
wok-show-berlin,5,2011-07-16,"Wok Show is my ultimate ace card for anybody who dares to find something local and (literally) hidden away. You should eat here often, as I try to do on a regular basis. Can easily drop a 40 (piece) on vegetarian Jiozi, all season long.
Especially prominent is the artwork that adorns the entire place, done by the store patriarch. Cannot confirm nor deny that the inspiration and motivation can be attributed to the hapless matriarch that befits this socialist paradise. Before the Prinzlberg wannabee yuppies infested most of the district, fortunately, this kiez is still keepin it Pankow  KaDeWedding stylee.
HIGHLY HIGHLY ESSENTIAL."
wok-show-berlin,4,2013-02-02,"Nice dumplings at a good price.
The main dishes are also pretty good but the portions are a bit on the small side, in fact by Berlin standards they are tiny, servings of rice also too small.
Fix the portion size and speed of service and you will get 5 stars from me!"
wok-show-berlin,5,2010-08-25,"i love this place. quiet, unassuming, great dumplings, reasonable price. pick from many varieties including pork and leek, vegetarian, and seafood. you can have them fried or steamed (i recommend a mixture). plenty of nice dipping sauces on the table.


 there will be little to no english spoken, but just point to anything in the dumpling menu and you will be happy.


 bring lots of friends. order a hundred assorted dumplings (less than 30 euro). have a great night."
wok-show-berlin,4,2012-03-30,"Wok show is great  Chinese food is hard to find in Berlin and this place was recommended to me by 2 friends who have lived in China. it's a nice treat. The atmosphere is also nice, every time (literally) I have been there, there has been large group of Chinese people eating there. Last time it was a big family (probably 15 adults) and the kids were wandering all over the place much to my and other diners general amusement and entertainment I find this kind of family vibe refreshing (not that I want all restaurants to be like that). There is also this quirky little painting studio in the window and here again I find that brings this sense that you are almost in someone's house. I have sent other friends here to who gave me rave reviews on other non-dumpling dishes they had (duck in particular) so would never hesitate to recommend Wok Show!"
wok-show-berlin,4,2009-05-05,"It's a bit of a shlep to this relatively small corner resto, tucked away on the corner of Greifenhagener and Kuglerstrasse, a few blocks north of U / S Schönhauser Allee. But walking is a big part of city life, and one that I relish each time I return for a vacation from the land of motorized travel....


 I was also experiencing withdrawals from my hometown haunt, Chopstick Express (http://bitchinberlin.wordpress.com/2008/12/10/chopstick-express-pa-2/) , so I was hoping for a good chili fix.


 Alas, while Sichuan-style dishes apparently can be ordered off the menu -- i.e. one knows the name of the dish in Chinese or German (which is a double loss for me, as I only know the fairly bad English translation) -- the main attraction are a variety of dumplings, steamed or pan-fried, which are prepared fresh daily.


 A cucumber salad appetizer could not transport me to the culinary high I so crave, and the specially prepared ma po tofu was galaxies away from ""my"" hometown dish. A kim-chi-ish appetizer of napa cabbage delivered on the sour & salty front, and the sliced beef was served with a sauce that had hints of peanut in it.


 At 5.50 EUR / 20 and 10.- EUR / 40 dumplings, this is a very good deal for larger groups of friends, and a VERY tasty one at that. Don't mistake the soy bottles for what they appear to be -- it's a dark vinegar (much tastier than the sodium bomb, anyway).


 It's a bit of a kicker to find the entry to the restrooms, as both the wall and the door are painted on with a pastoral landscape -- after a few beers (and for your first trip to the loo) it can be a bit confusing.


 On my way out I saw a dish reminiscent of the awesomeness that is ""Diced chicken w/hot peppers"", and pleaded the owner to prepare this dish for our next outing. Fingers crossed!


 FYI, all dumplings are also available frozen for take-out, which makes a delish finger food option for the lazy party host.


 As for my chili quest, I'm back to square one '-("
wok-show-berlin,2,2011-02-02,"How to eat at Wok Show:


 1) Assemble a group of people whose excitement over the idea of a dumpling feast is a bigger motivator than flavor. Ideally, they'll be either stoned or hungover.


 2) Once you get there, don't be in a hurry. While the kitchen is quite fast, the service is not; your drink orders might arrive in half an hour, along with notification that half of the menu isn't available. If for some reason you want wine, BYO. Trust.


 3) Order lots of dumplings. Don't worry, they're cheap, and by the time they arrive you'll be hungry enough to eat the table. No need to deliberate over which fillings to get; they all taste exactly the same, which is to say they don't taste of much at all. Get some fried - the dough really comes alive when it's seared to a crisp, not greasy at all. If you're more into mouth-feel than taste, you'll be polyorgasmic by now.


 4) If you were the kind of child who chewed on rubber bands during school lunch, try an order of pig ears. Otherwise, disregard the rest of the menu, which is full of disappointments.


 5) You can't be blamed for sneaking in your own dipping-sauce ingredients, as the ones on the table taste slightly rancid. But be discreet, of course! No need to plop a chopping board on the table and embarrass your guests.


 6) Still waiting for another drink? Pause and enjoy the random artwork crowded into the walls and obscured by bright direct lights. The decor may not exactly work, but you've gotta hand it to them for trying."
wok-show-berlin,4,2011-11-27,"We've only had takeaway from here. The dumplings are definitely a highlight. Staff are very friendly, price is perfectly fine for decent quality food. Would recommend it in this area."
wok-show-berlin,1,2013-10-25,"I'm just back from dinner here. I will NEVER go back. I was pretty happy with the food, but the service, especially as we were leaving was HORRIBLE, absolutely atrocious. In a nearly empty restaurant (somewhat early on a Friday night, so understandable) we were seated in a side room that soon filled up with a large party. Nothing against that, except that it was so loud that we couldn't enjoy our own dinner or conversation, so we felt rushed. On our way out, we saw plenty of still-empty tables in the front of the restaurant, and politely commented that it was very loud back where we'd been seated, and it would have been nice if we could have had a quieter table, gesturing to all the empty tables up front. The owner said they were all already reserved. Well, they were all empty when we came in, and were empty when we were leaving. I pointed this out, and said, well still, it wasn't so nice. 

She actually mimicked me, ""Oh, it wasn't so nice.... well, it's nice for us! Ha ha ha!) Meaning, I guess, that they're making a lot of money from the big party and the booked out tables. RUDE, more than rude - the owner mocked me to my face. 

I am still so angry. This restaurant owner is totally in the wrong business if she thinks this is how to treat customers."
wok-show-berlin,4,2009-07-26,"i went here for the dumplings, and i was not disappointed. handmade and pretty yummy. prices are writted in another review so i won't touch on that. you can get them boiled or fried. i agree that it didn't make sense to put vinegar into the bottle which was marked soy sauce and soy sauce into the vinegar bottle. strange. in any case, if you want dumplings, you can stuff your face here for a pretty decent price. i took a pack of 40 frozen for home too."
wok-show-berlin,4,2010-03-13,Great jiaozi!
wok-show-berlin,4,2009-11-15,"Went to Wok Show for the first time today. Ordered a wan tan suppe (small portion, tasty with excellent wan tans, broth had a hint of sesame oil). Tried the fried vegetable dumplings...excellent! Not too greasy, browned perfectly. The soy sauce was brought to the table but I used vinegar instead mixed with some spicy sauces. Best dumplings I've had in Berlin...I'll be back to try some meat dishes very soon! I saw a Sezchuan dish on someone else's table that looked and smelled delicious, even to my vegetarian boyfriend."
feedback-berlin-5,5,2017-09-30,"very delicious! especially all kinds of local Cantonese style DIM-SUM, which stands out among other chinese restaurant~"
feedback-berlin-5,5,2016-02-25,"Like just : AMAZING ! 
once you go there ...you'll just wish /want to move to Berlin just to be able to try all dishes EVERY DAY !
on top of being delicious they are decorated in such an exquisite and elegant way that can only assure you ""you won't be disappointed""
hope you will all enjoy as much as i did. definitely recommendable! 
service is super sweet, the place has a great decoration, all is very clean
my best advise is : GO ! GO ! GO!  TRY! TRY!"
feedback-berlin-5,5,2017-07-06,"Visiting from New York City  for only five days and was lucky enough to be brought to this exquisite restaurant by my friend Jake. Better than any of the restaurants back home - freshest flavors and most delicious combinations I've encountered. Tofu has never tasted so good - whether quickly deep fried or sautéed or smoked. Shumai and wontons were perfect and light and wasabi shrimp out of this world.  And how can a humble cucumber salad be that amazing?
Gracious service; beautiful outdoor setting, lovely bottle of Albariño and above all scrumptious food. A must."
feedback-berlin-5,3,2016-12-09,"Nothing special. It's pretty much your average Chinese place, but a bit more expensive. The dim sum is better than the Hauptgerichte."
feedback-berlin-5,1,2016-04-02,"Really confused by the reviews and I am not even a foodie.  I had their version of Kung Po chicken and it was almost inedible and the dish was about 50% oyster sauce with very little meat.  They do have a nice outdoor eating area if you just want to have a beer, but I would stay away from the food if you are remotely used to real Chinese food."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2015-10-21,"This is a massive operation; right across the Chinese embassy. On a Wednesday evening, it was packed, with both Chinese and non-Chinese diners inside. There were plenty of Chinese diners; that for me was a good sign.

We decided to stick to ordering little things, and avoiding the main dishes. By the way, the main dishes are huge, so bring an appetite in case you want to order one of those (they come with rice). We ordered the 1000-year-old eggs (we liked it so much we ordered a second one), the spicy tripe, steamed dimsum with pork and vegetables, as well as small servings of the shark fin soup, as well as the sea cucumber soup. We also ordered a pair of non-alcoholic cocktails, simply because their juices looked interesting enough.

Oh, the millennium eggs were great! It looked disgusting, but it melts in your mouth. I loved it. I haven't had it here in Berlin, until now. I was missing it, so it was time to feast on it. 

The spicy tripe was also a great dish. It was not too hot, in my opinion, although I remember them marketing it as rather hot. I guess it's not Szechuan cuisine. Regardless, I loved it.

And finally, the dimsum, which was heavenly.

The soups were interesting, but I should say that the shark fin soup had more hype than taste. I can't say I hate it, but I am not a fan. I guess it is just popular because of its ingredients, but I didn't really see why people make a big deal of it. In my opinion, I found the sea cucumber soup tastier.

Overall, I had a good experience here. I would definitely come back again."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,3,2017-06-03,"It's a reasonably nice place, the waiters were friendly, no problems, the food was... ok. Not great, but ok. The buffet is pretty small and lacks some more sauces (if you offer duck, fish, etc. by itself, I expect more sauces to go with it than just sweet&sour). One meat (I think it was beef) was only lukewarm at best and pretty chewy, which was also true for some of the other stuff. Personally, I would not recommand the buffet, but we will probably go again and try something from the menu."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,2,2015-12-26,People say that it's the best Chinese restaurant in Berlin but I think it might be a bit overrated. There is a big selection of food. Even the most fancy things like shark fins. The menu is very authentic. My boyfriend and I (both from China) decided to have some daily food though. We had Dan Dan Mian (sichuan noodle) and sauer sweet fish. The portion of the sauer sweet fish was not very big. It tastes okay but not so amazing. The noodle was too soft and it was just a bowl of noodle. There should be more meat. The kiwi alcohol free cocktail was disgusting. The staff was friendly though. And the price was okay. Maybe I will try the all you can eat or the more fancy stuff some other day.
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2014-07-06,"One of the best Chinease Restaurants in Berlin. They have a huge selection of dishes on the menu, way more that you will find in a lot of other places. The menu is really Chinease with a lot of ""exotic"" dishes like pigs ears, intestines, chicken feet etc. We had some starters and some meat dishes. The portions are really generous and the meat dishes come with rice. I will certainly go back there, great find. 
The location is also nice, you can sit outside and have a direct view on the Spree."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2016-06-08,The buffet is huge and full if interesting stuff... Very good for 15 euros..Some of the food are slightly customized to western tastes so that bit is irritating... The dumplings are fresh and tasty...Everything else is quite good and authentic.
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,2,2014-08-21,"I'm Chinese and the food here is awful. The Beef dish was too salty. 
We also got the duck pancake, wow the pancake they used was soggy and not the correct one I rate that ""F"" Bad Bad. 
Close to Potsdamer Platz there is a GOOD duck pancake place Pek-Ente or something.
Dim sum nothing special. Overall, I will NOT return."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2012-04-22,"Real chinese restaurant across the street of the Chinese Embassy. Once, when  I was invited to the 60. Anniversary of the Republic of China Act in the Embassy, this restaurant was the caterer. God food, some of them so authentic, that you are warned by the staff. I highly recommend this restaurant"
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,2,2012-07-08,"I gave 2 stars mainly because of the Unfriendly Waiter who made me feel sorry about asking anything,
I assume he's the son of the owner. Unfriendly and somehow rude.
Food is Ok, a bit on the pricey side considering the quality of the food:
We got Half Duck which was good, but the sauce was far too acid.
Rice was good.
Vegetables were ok, but not worthy of 8EUR.
Won ton soup with prawns is too expensive, 5,80EUR for a very small portion,
and taste too much like sesame sauce. 
I tried many chinese restaurants and this one is not gonna be on my list,
def. i won't go back to eat here."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2014-04-12,"This place is amazing! The location is very easy to get to, and the menus have ENGLISH! The english menu made the restaurant quite welcoming and put us at ease when ordering. 

The food itself is quite good, and the service is reasonable by Berlin/European standards."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2013-07-04,Authentic Sichuan cuisine. One of the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to when I'm abroad.
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2012-12-30,"The mixed review from this restaurant is probably because of its originality and Non Asians, who are used to the cheap Asian noodles around the corner.

The food is typical food of the zhejiang province. They don't do dim sums, so I didn't bother ordering dim sum. I have been here a couple of times already. If you want to experience original zhejiang cooking this is the place and order from the menu. I've tried the buffet, but the quality is not the same."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,2,2012-07-07,"Standing proudly just across from the Chinese Embassy I expected a great deal from this Restaurant. The food was mediocre, the restaurant looks reasonable nice and it's relatively clean. Although I got a dirty knife and a dirty look for asking for a replacement knife. The Mapo Tofu was not like any I'd seen before in my life and there was about 9 grains of mince in the sauce which I know because they were so few I could count them. They have a wide selection of Dim Sum and I had a selection, I was only really satisfied with one of the selections the others tasted like rubber (probably because they were using rubber in the steamers) . I have, unfortunately, no Idea where they got the good reputation they are supposed to have."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2013-07-14,It's hard to find good authentic Chinese Food outside of China.  This place is awesome.
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2012-03-03,"fantastic food. huge selection from many Chinese regions and perfectly done. especially interesting is the dim sum selection  i cant seem to have enough of those and find myself coming back again and again.
the prices are moderate (45EUR for a couple) and the service is very professional.
on Sunday there is a buffet that is boring and not recommended."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2011-08-12,"I've been to the Ming Dynasty I several times, every visit has been a success, good food and good service. The highlight was the the Feuertopf (hot pot) which I shared with a friend one Christmas Eve. Lovely sauces and generous amounts of food. They top up everything as much as required, even the prawns which my friend really tucked into. The tofu was the freshest and the best I can remember having and it was the first time I had the sliced noodles. The peanut/chilii sauce is to die for.
I have also had the buffet for Sunday lunch. This is very good (and good value as well), if not as much a gourmet experience as the hot pot. A good selection of noodles, meat dishes,fish, spring rolls and even some sushi. In particular I enjoyed the crispy duck and the fried prawns/shrimps. The food is continually topped up so things don't run out, even the popular items.
Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in town!"
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,4,2011-02-05,"Great dim sum,tasty wantons(i really love the fried one),to mantion the fried chicken with shenchuan pepper::is a twice fried chicken meet with skin,covered with a mountain of dry chilly.the dish havo no sauce at all and it's very spice.The desserts are bit boring,the usual banana frittes,and ice creams.
Authentic chinese food."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2009-05-29,"Terrific food, with a range of unusual items that one rarely sees in standard Chinese restaurants. No doubt its location right across from the Chinese embassy helps to get the kitchen honest. Certainly worth a visit."
ming-dynastie-berlin-5,5,2008-12-12,"Arguably the best Chinese in town. Good friends is good too and has more roast meats, but Ming Dynasty has a better dim sum and vegetarian menu. The wantons are really really yummy, with a little bit of lemongrass in the stuffing - miam miam. The only negative point is there a very light wine list: there's like 2 reds to choose from and no rosé (which is really de rigueur with Chinese food). Last time I was there I had the 'Great Wall red (produced in China) and it really wasn't that good. The traditional Peking Duck is a must (book 24hrs in advance), as well as the fondue (really popular with their Chinese clientele it seems)."
good-friends-berlin,5,2017-08-27,"One of my favorite Chinese place, fast service, staffs who can speak Chinese, English, German and Vietnamese.

Nice food, price acceptable, nice location"
good-friends-berlin,5,2017-08-14,"We have been visiting Good Friends for over ten years now and have never been disappointed by the service or the quality of the food.
The restaurant can be quite overfilled on the weekend so to all the annoyed people out there: reserve yourself a table!"
good-friends-berlin,4,2017-06-28,"Went to Good Friends for lunch and ordered grilled pork, duck and stir fry Choi Sam. The service was good and efficient, unlike some other restaurants with arrogant attitude from the waitresses. Food was tasty though grilled pork is a little too salty. Definitely an authentic Chinese cuisine. Will come back again in the future"
good-friends-berlin,5,2016-09-18,"One of my favorite restaurants in berlin. 
The food is really good and authentic. 
Good service and great atmosphere. 
Always a pleasure!!!"
good-friends-berlin,5,2015-09-30,"I'm really happy that I could find a good Cantonese restaurant in Berlin,  So far I have tired many different kind of the Chinese cuisine, from different regions in China here. I always wondered if there is a one just for Cantonese. And then passed this place the other day, just couldn't help myself to give it a try. And it was just amazing, really tasted just like what I can have in my hometown. I ordered the most typical and delicious dish from here, the Cantonese roast duck.  It was really good, I enjoyed the meal a lot. Even my friends he wanted it so bad, the only reason he didn't pick it because of it got bones on it. But let's say he was a bit regret it, after he saw my dish. We also ordered some din sums,  the spring roll with shrimp was quite good, my personal favorite is the Har Gow (that is Cantonese, which means dumpling with shrimp). Just give it a try, you might love it. 

I went there with my partner and friends. At the end, we all enjoyed our food really much. The restaurant offers not only traditional Cantonese dishes, but also the westernize dished. So in this case, depend on the guest's mood, surely can find something on the menu. The restaurant is right next to the main street. It's really easy to find. Beside, you can have a peek of the roast duck from the window. Inside the restaurant has a really traditional Chinese style, how it decorated and how the tables set. It could be nice place to get to know some Chinese culture.  The waiters sort of remind me the waiters in Hong Kong, very efficient and don't talk much, but warm inside, if you need anything just ask. The price here is generally alright. When we were there, the restaurant was completely full, we were quite lucky , got a table without waiting. After a while we sat down, the waiting line start to appeared. And it was end until outside the restaurant. That is a good sign for the restaurant.  Just try to reserve a table, if you want to go. Otherwise it will really depend on luck and what time you are going. For me, no doubt, this is one of the great places for Cantonese cuisine in berlin. I will come here. Thumbs up!"
good-friends-berlin,5,2017-03-03,"Visited for the second time today and food was really delicious. First visit went for sweet and sour chicken then on the second visit decided to try fried noodles with beef and I LOVED IT! Also, generous portions. Must try!"
good-friends-berlin,4,2015-04-22,"I am probably biased, since I am not the best expert when it comes to asian food.

The staff was formally friendly (which is a diplomatic form of saying, a bit stiff on the communication side of things). Yet they were pretty quick, and the food tasted fine.

The pricing is more than fair, and the location is easy to reach with the public transportation system."
good-friends-berlin,4,2016-08-05,"Really good chinese food, try some fish dishes. Kind staff. A bit noisy and busy. They had TVs inside the restaurant for the Eurocup and I don't like football :("
good-friends-berlin,5,2015-05-18,"Had a family dinner at Good Friends just now. I was quite impressed by the food. Not bad at all. We are from Southeast Asia and has been traveling for alkost 1 month in Europe. 

We miss asian food and ""Good Friends"" is a good place to satisfied our taste bud"
good-friends-berlin,5,2016-01-07,"been there many times - and it is always a blast. We had the peking duck yesterday - which is a starter, actually. Even for me, the big eater: excellent."
good-friends-berlin,3,2014-08-22,"I was here for dinner with two other companions earlier tonight. Since one of them wanted to try out a Chinese place here in Charlottenburg, we opted to start with this place. I placed a reservation earlier in the week, and when we arrived, sure enough, a table was waiting for us.

We ordered several dishes, all to share. We ordered the dimsum platter, as well as a wantan soup for starters. After that, we also ordered the pork belly fried with snow peas, as well as the chicken fried with asparagus. 

I should say that I had better Chinese food somewhere else. Not that this place is bad; in fact, the number of people eating here are enormous, and so they must be doing something good. But I have to say that there are other places that have more spectacular food, and this place just ends up as being okay for me. I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would also want to try other places as well.

One tip: there is a difference between the orange part of the menu and the green part of the menu. The orange section is for Germans, while the green section is for those who want to try authentic Cantonese cooking. We only ordered from the green section of the menu, yet it still felt like I was eating Chinese food from the United States. 

Overall, not bad, but not stellar either."
good-friends-berlin,4,2016-04-06,Super yummy food and almost authentic like the food you may find in China.There are some pretty exotic cantonese dishes too.I was sitting close to the kitchen and was surprised to see the variety of the dishes they serve.and yes i was totally salivating!
good-friends-berlin,5,2016-05-09,Amazing! Nice dim sum. Great main dishes. Good desserts. This is the real Chinese food :) Everything falls perfectly
good-friends-berlin,2,2016-01-31,"Waiters are kind, but restaurant looks shabby and the food is the worst we've ever eaten. Nothing more to say."
good-friends-berlin,4,2014-06-22,"After the bad experience at another Asian restaurant in Drsden called Good Friends, I'm going to try again with this Chinese restaurant called Good Friends...two times the charm!

We ordered the seaweed tomato fish soup which was seasoned nicely, and the soup was very good. The roasted pork/duck/BBQ pork over Chinese cabbage was moist and juicy..just right. Mom got the beef chow fun noodles, and that was fine. I really liked the fried halibut with black bean sauce ( which was a mistake cause we ordered steamed, so we got the fried fish for free). The clay pot of tofu, cow stomach and vegetables were nicely seasoned. The steamed halibut in light soy sauce was well cooked but I kept getting a mouthful of bones. The shanghai bok choy as fresh and light.

We did good here, I figured if there's enough local Chinese people in this place, then we won't go wrong like yesterday."
good-friends-berlin,4,2016-04-04,Best hot and sour soup I've ever had.  Very big menu with regular and Cantonese offerings.  Large seating area but it is pretty busy so don't forget to call ahead.
good-friends-berlin,4,2014-08-09,"Not the best Chinese food in town in my opinion but it's always nice. The service truly is five stars. 
It's always easy to get a table."
good-friends-berlin,3,2013-11-30,"Many long-time Berliners have suggested this place, but to me it's just average greasy-spoon Chinese food--and expensive for what it is.

It is popular though, and finding an open table is a challenge. There must, must be better in this city. I will endeavour to find it and post it here for you! Soon."
good-friends-berlin,3,2013-04-16,"You must set expectations here not too high! The Interior is completely outdated, it is loud and crowded! The waiter quickly overloaded and in Streß and forget ever order one or the other.
The food was  partly  good, the fish is unfortunately not quite through. To order a second drink, you have to wait long.
But even so I would have a second chance Good Friends."
good-friends-berlin,4,2013-01-24,"Many people love this restaurant, and there really is delicious! Such as soup with prawns ... But how do we prepare the duck did not like! There are dishes that are not found in other Chinese restaurants! Worth a visit and make up your experience ..."
good-friends-berlin,4,2012-08-16,"I like this place! The staff are not always the friendliest bunch but they are not unfriendly or rude and the food is great! Here we ordered 4 types Dim Sum as a starter all of which tasted great, no essence of rubber like I have experienced in other restaurants. Mapo Tofu was very tasty and a little spicy (mildly spicy for a chilly eater such as myself). The fried scallops with king prawns,macadamia nuts and fresh asparagus was very nice if a bit pricey for what you get. I shared all of this with someone else of course. The restaurant is often busy and has many Chinese customers which is usually a good indicator of quality for a Chinese restaurant. They have seats outside in the summer, if you are a non-smoker try to get a table upwind from the others!"
good-friends-berlin,3,2012-05-31,"3.5 stars. 

After getting off the plane, the first thing i wanted to eat wasn't any German grubs (wursts and the surprising popularity of boba tea), but for some Chinese food.  I'm an Asian gal at heart afterall.  And I guess when in a foreign land, you crave for homey meals.  Luckily, our hotel was very close to many Asian restaurants and one of them was Good Friends, which has been firing up the wok in Berlin for quite awhile.  The dishes are mainly Canton-style, with great emphasis on seafoods, dim sum and the typical 'Chinese' rice and noodle dishes.  With low expectation, we were surprised by the 'wok hei' from the stir-fry rice noodle and the availability of Chinese vegetables.  Each main entree includes a BIG tub of rice (a bit dry and definitely not jasmine rice), which is meant to fill you up, family style.  Although the price tags are doubled what I'd pay for in NYC Chinatown, I happily patronized several Asian restaurants during my trip to Berlin. The cooking skills are definitely on par with what I experience here and better yet, the foods were fresh and sauce not overly-salted, but do inform the wait staff that you do not want MSG in your food because Chinese restaurants do add on this flavor-enhancer."
good-friends-berlin,4,2012-11-17,The best Chinese I've had in Berlin. I miss china town a lot. Good Friends eased that a bit.
good-friends-berlin,1,2014-03-18,"The Dim Sum is NOT good and WAY to expensive for its quality. I have been to other places and this Place is the worst. If you like to experience REAL traditional Dim Sum in good quality, better go to Long March Canteen or Yumcha Heros! There You actually enjoy the food, for the same price!"
good-friends-berlin,4,2014-08-03,"After we saw the (mixed but mostly positive) reviews, we decided to give this place a shot. We ordered the Peking Duck. The pancakes were very light and thin, and the duck was excellent. The soup we ordered was very authentic. Everything was quite good. We had no problem getting a table indoors (however, it was a Sunday night). Those looking for an Asian fix, this place is perfect."
good-friends-berlin,4,2010-06-25,"really nice place, good food, lot of chinese people. Food is fresh and crispy, great. And price-quality relation is also good. Not to expensive.


 Try ist out and fel good."
good-friends-berlin,2,2009-12-13,"I've been here a few times before over the years and was here last night. The food is ""trying to be"" Cantonese style - but fails miserably. I know a lot of people say that it's one of the best places for Chinese food in Berlin (which is probably true) but I rather go without eating Chinese food EVER in Berlin (or cook it yourself!) For those who have been to Chinatowns around Europe e.g. London, Manchester or Amsterdam, Good Friends doesn't even come close. The food is over cooked, greasy and way too much on the flavouring.
One final point, what turned this report from 1 star to 2 stars is that the ""dim sum"" is OK for lunch."
good-friends-berlin,5,2012-04-06,"Good friends is my one of my favourite dim sum restaurant in Berlin. The steamed dishes are soft, delicate and well made. The fillings are fresh and innovative. The food is marvellous, the staff are friendly and the restaurant itself is neat & clean, don't await any big decorations. Mostly people come here to eat good food, defenatielly not for wonderful atmosphere."
good-friends-berlin,3,2013-03-13,"This place was recommended by a friend, and so tonight we had dinner here.  It was ok -- nothing bad, but not great.  Service was good and fairly prompt.  Overall, it's a bit too expensive for what you get, and there's better Asian (if not Chinese) in the neighbourhood."
good-friends-berlin,1,2010-05-17,"Good Friends is a much hyped Chinese restaurant loved for its 'authentic' Chinese food by the local Berliners. It actually got another positive review in the Berlin zitty 2010/2011 restaurant guide...much to my surprise. The times I've eaten there, I left with a massive allergic reaction to their liberal use of MSG. My tongue was burned for hours. Based on the positive reviews in German, I can only conclude that most Germans have no clue when food is truly delicious or truly horrible. So, if your definition of authentic Chinese cooking includes lots of MSG and Indonesian and Japanese dishes, then this is the place for you!


 1. The Food
Decent if you're starving and haven't eaten in weeks. Awful if you're Chinese or grew up eating some kind of Chinese cuisine (Cantonese, Taiwanese, Hainan, Fujian, IndoChinese etc.). At Good Friends, they don't even stick to a particular cuisine, offering a variety of Asian dishes. Last time I checked, nasi goreng was Indonesian fried rice. Before trying some more 'authentic' dishes, I usually try the Won Ton soup or some other basic pork/meat dumpling because these are super easy to make and a good benchmark to gauge the kitchen and whether they use artificial MSG. Sadly, dumplings at Good Friends s are bland, overcooked and heavily MSG-ed. The plain steamed rice is decent, nothing special. Their veggie dishes are overcooked or oversteamed, most arriving in a post-limp state. In addition, most sauces and glaces rely heavily on cornstarch and are greasy and slimy. As for the dishes with meat, overly greasy and not of great quality.


 2. The Staff 
Quick but not always eager to see you. If you order in Mandarin or Cantonese, they do become a bit friendlier.


 3. The atmosphere
Old-school Chinese restaurant, including the token cats, reddish interior, ducks in the window and aquariums with seafood. Relatively high quota of Chinese, some who cleverly order off-menu items or pre-order.


 4. The damage
Expect to pay 10-17 euros per entree. Drinks are 2-10. Beer, not so much wine.


 5. Useful tidbits
Make a reservation elsewhere."
good-friends-berlin,4,2010-09-19,OMG! I found a chinese restaurant that serves Dim Sum around the clock...the other dishes are not bad either.  It's just a little funny the bus boy and waiter all spoke German and not English.  It's a good thing I spoke Chinese
good-friends-berlin,5,2012-04-29,"Wir gehen bei fast jedem Berlinbesuch hier hin. Ist ein wenig wie ein kleiner Urlaub im Urlaub. Den meisten Rezensionen kann ich nur beipflichten: Die Speisekarte ist sehr umfangreich und doch haben wir bei allen probierten Gerichten noch nie einen Reinfall erlebt. Die Gerichte schmecken meines Erachtens ähnlich wie ich sie in Peking erwarten würde, aber ich meine, dass einige kleine Kompromisse für den deutschen Gaumen gemacht werden, was ich positiv sehe. Wer jedoch das Ambiente und den Geschmack der normalen 0 8 15 Chinarestaurants in Deutschland sucht, sollte einen Bogen um dieses Restaurant machen, da er wahrscheinlich enttäuscht wird. Unsere Kinder lieben Shrimps, Reis und Nudeln in allen Varianten. Wir Erwachsenen wagen uns dann schon mal auch an etwas schärferes.Der Preis ist für die Qualität angemessen. Die Bedienung ist freundlich. Wir freuen uns schon auf das Nächste Mal in diesem Restaurant."
good-friends-berlin,2,2008-03-22,"This is by far the best Cantonese restaurant in Berlin. The owners hail from Malaysia rather than Hong Kong, and therefore there is a slight slant towards Malaysian Chinese food, which I really like, rather than the ubiquitous sour-sweet concoctions favored by Hong Kong Chinese places.


 The first impression is that this place is gregarious and efficient, and that is what it is, although they won't mind you leaving quickly after your meal as they like to pack in as many sittings as possible. The tables have glass on top of the tablecloths so that it can be cleaned and made available quickly for the next customer.


 The menu is extensive but if you know Chinese food, you can easily spot that many of them are variations of simple stir-fried wok dishes. Which is not always a bad thing. But I like to order off-menu wherever possible and this is where the cook excels. Throw him a challenge and he (usually) responds pretty darn well. For example, ask for a Hokkien steamed pork mince with salted duck egg. Delicious. Or fried sticky lobster noodles with spring onions and ginger. Try to ask for anything from any other restaurant that you have liked and see what turns up.


 But they serve a pretty weak tim sum selection and their roast duck (made on-site) is not really up to it, and neither is their white steamed chicken with ginger. They have also gotten rather pricey over the last 2-3 years, which is not quite justified, in my opinion. A special lobster dish can now cost more than 70 Euro by itself! However, compared to any other Chinese Cantonese place I have tried in Germany, this place still walks away with the prize.


 NOTE: Since late 2008, this place has been going downhill and picking up pace as it does so. I would now rate it the most overpriced Chinese restaurant in Berlin relative to the quality of the food served."
good-friends-berlin,5,2012-07-29,most authentic chinese venue in town. great staff. reservation absolutely recommended. go for the waiters suggestions. forget the menu. live lobsters and freshest vegetables.
good-friends-berlin,5,2012-07-16,Mein liebling chinesische Restaurant in Berlin. Das Essen ist lecker. Die Zubereitung ist sehr schnell. Ich wündere mich wie sie so schnell machen kann. Sehr empfehlenwert
good-friends-berlin,4,2012-05-31,"5 sterne dafuer, weil der authentischste chinese in berlin. gibt es schon seit ich denken kann, und ist meist gefuellt mit vielen chinesen.
keine rind/schwein/huhn mit rote/weisse/gruene curry sauce
nein, hier gibt es china essen, wie es in china selbst nicht anders ist.
nun, chinesisch ist schon geschmackssache, gerade wenn mann die viet/chinesischen restaurants gewohnt ist aber wer es wirklich wissen will, sollte hier her kommen.
preise ok, bedienung ok. ( da nur ok ein stern abzug)"
good-friends-berlin,2,2011-01-27,"food is not all that it's hyped up to be, prices are kinda steep and their service sucks..."
good-friends-berlin,3,2009-01-13,"From 1 (worst) to 5 (best)
Food taste: 3 Good.
Food variety: 4 A lot.
Price: 3 OK.
Mobility: Easy to reach.


 Recommendation and comment:
With reservation is better. Above average chinese restaurant."
good-friends-berlin,3,2009-04-28,"I've been going to Good Friends for almost 2 years and have to say the food isn't as good as it was when I first started going there. The Dim Sum tray, although expensive, remains excellent. The other dishes are OK, but not great. Some tend to be a little greasy. I have found better Chinese restaurants in Berlin since then. I was last there about 2 weeks ago and the food was not that good and was NOT hot and spicy as stated on the menu. I had to use a whole jar of the chili sauce. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this one anymore."
good-friends-berlin,5,2008-11-12,I am a often visitor of this restaurant and their food always kept everytime I visit in a excellent quality. I got some friends from san fran visited me last week and we tried ming dynasty their food was too fat and too much oil. I thought maybe this is a nice restaurant and not too lousy like good friends so I brought my friends there but the food wasn't nice. It's more a western chinese style NOT real chinese food where u get at GOOD FRIENDS. I would rather recommend good friends if u like to have REAL chinese food
lon-men-berlin,5,2015-06-10,"The best Chinese restaurant in Berlin #not just ""one of""#

Tried 4 dishes, loved all of them!
Wu xi pai gu (ribs)
Handmade fish ball soup
Shui Zhu yu (spicy fish)
Xiang chao ya (duck)

For people who want to taste really Chinese food, this is the place."
lon-men-berlin,5,2008-08-04,"Of course, the most-important point of all is the food itself: I found it quite good. It was well-seasoned and obviously fresh (including the sauce.) This seems to be a well established family restaurant which may be in its third or fourth generation. The rice was also a better jasmine variety than the norm--these small details can really add to the meal.


 The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite nice in that earlier Chinese tradition, where the interior is quite ornate and the tables are actually vitrines with ornate woodwork inside, covered by glass. I can imagine this would be a great place to take a larger party to, or for a special family outing.


 The service was also quite good.


 All in all, I would have to rate my experience there as very good."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,5,2014-12-10,"The Beef Noodle Soup is really excellent and tastes just like in China. I have never eaten are more authentic and better Beef Noodle Soup anywhere in Germany. The beef is super tender, sauce has the right flavor and the vegetables are fresh.

Also all other dishes are really tasty. They are very authentic and taste like if you eat at someone's home in China. Therefore the dishes are not super fancy, but it's not needed as they just do everything right at this restaurant.

The restaurant is run by an old Shanghainese man and his wife. They are very welcoming, friendly and do everything they can to make their guests happy. It's one of those places you'll certainly walk out with a smile.

Highly recommending this restaurant. Consider to book a table on Friday nights."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,4,2017-10-17,xiaolongbao is legit! My favorite is 卤肉饭! It's better to make a reservation before coming!
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,3,2016-02-18,"This place has potential but I guess I ordered the wrong thing. It is also not super chinese chinese but rather the lighter, softer less oily korean and japnese inspired chinese food 

I got the beef noodles (红烧牛肉面）which was good. The broth tastes like shoyu (soysauce) based which is not something I expect from this dish. Then the noodles are inspired by Japanese ramen.  Well made but still not niu rou mian that I know. 

They have daily special for lunch as well and for thursday it is 鱼香茄子 or aubergine in yuxiang sauce which i was gonna order but i thick the eggplants were a big too thickly cut and looked like deep fried so i didnt order

Might come back later to try the squid with kimchi or the xiaolongbao

Service was great and reasonably priced. The restaurant is clean and every dish is made to order by a very nice lady


Also, no tap water ?!?"
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,3,2017-04-29,"The light in this restaurant is a bit too bright, but the food they offer is quite ok. Rice can refilled and the meat or squid taste tender! For 104 beef noodle soup, the beef is chewy, noodle could be better and the soup is a bit too salty. And for 35 curry chicken, overall is nice but is actually not so specially which you could have almost the same taste as in other restaurants..."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,5,2017-04-16,"Super nice service, super nice homemade noodles and their broth is like CRACK!! Totally addicted after the first hit of spicy noodlesoup"
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,4,2014-12-15,"After reading serval reviews, my partner and I decided to go to have try it out ourselves. Shaniu's noodle soup restaurant is quite close to the U-Bahn station Spichernstr.. From the station, it took me less 5 mins to find the restaurant. The restaurant itself wasn't so big, but very nice decorated and good atmosphere. 

After we sat down not long later the waiter brought the menu to us. I spent quite awhile just to see what food they offer. Most of them seem very good. But first I would like to try some sea food, so I ordered the seafood noodle soup, Shao Mai and dumplings. 

The seafood noodle soup I ordered was quite nice, very light and it tasted good, I think however it could be better, something was missing in the soup for me. Sadly to say, I have tasted something better in Berlin.  I personally like the dumplings very much, it tasted very special, only if there were bigger I would like it more. Shao Mai was also good. Dishes like this with such as low price, best thing could ever happened. 

After the meals, I started to with the chief a bit. She told me that their kitchen actually mix with Shanghai and Korean style. That was the reason dumplings tasted different, compared with other Chinese restaurants I have been. Some of the noodle soups reminded me the noodle soup from south of China, the looks and the tastes. The service was also really nice and friendly. During the time I was there, I saw quite a lot customers enjoying their meals very much, that was something.

Overall, I like it here, very cool price with delicious food. Although it isn't so close to where I stay, I could see myself come back again."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,4,2015-11-20,"We had a great seafood noodle soup in this place. The slow cooked pork was not that superb (the sauce was a bit to jellylike and the meat quite dry) but the noodles were good.
Price/quality is good, we ate and drank here for 18€ total."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,4,2016-10-26,"This place was a good find thanks to all the yelpers out there. I ordered the beef brisket noodles, bok choi stir fried with shiitake and garlic and chicken with chili oil (was hungry). I was pleasantly surprised on how authentic these dishes tasted having gone to Shanghai a couple of months back.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for some good food. As a added bonus, the staff was very friendly."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,5,2017-04-09,Excellent food. Duck and dumplings excellent. Very friendly waiters and owner. Price ok. I totally recommend.
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,4,2015-02-10,"On a spontaneous decision, my companion and I went here. I have bookmarked this place already, having read glowing reviews before, so when we were feeling lazy and didn't want to cook at home on a weekday evening, I suggested heading here. 

I should say that it was a good thing that we came in a tad early: we entered at around 19:00 and an hour later, it was packed. I should suggest making a reservation even during the weekday, as I felt like we were simply lucky enough to be early.

I have mixed feelings about this place. On the one hand, I loved the appetizers: the marinated pork knuckle was tasty, and the spicy sauce matched it well. The xiaolongbao, while rather diminutive and smaller than other soup dumplings I have had before, was also delicious. 

The soups, on the other hand, were good, but not spectacular. I had the noodle soup with pork belly: the broth was dark and tasty, the meat was good, but the noodles were a little bit too heavy for me. I couldn't see myself being eager and overly excited about this. 

Perhaps I am biased to the Japanese ramen: after all, having lived in Japan, that is my standard of what a noodle soup should be, and perhaps the Chinese variety is just too bland and zurückgehalten for my taste. There's simply more bells and whistles in the Japanese noodle soup. Hence I am still giving this place 4 stars. The staff after all were great and did everything as they were supposed to be done. And since I haven't been to China yet to evaluate whether they really are doing noodles the way it should be done, then I will give them the benefit of the doubt and rate it 4 out of 5."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,2,2015-11-22,"Last day visiting Berlin from DC. The service was poor. We waited 10minutes to order drinks. People were not pay attention on their customers. However, food came quick once we ordered. The beef noodle soup was fine. But the spicy chicken doesn't has any taste. Too plain. Only chilly oil but doesn't taste any spicy at all. The tofu with black mushroom
 was not good at all. No traditional sweet taste of Shanghai dish at all. Too much soy source on tofu & looked too dark. It's ok food. Clean place. Since it was rated so high, it came out disappointed. Was expected much more!!"
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,4,2015-01-08,"I have been here 2 or 3 times recently and have to say that it is very good, it's definitely not German-Chinese!!! :-)  I had Gongbao chicken on the daily specials menu, sautéed green beans, beef & bok choy on rice noodles and beef with onions. Most main dishes average 6€ but then there are other dishes for ca. 9€ (beef with noodles and beef with onions).

The portions are ample and satisfying."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,4,2015-01-17,"I went here last night, after a very long trek..

I had the gluten cakes (like seitan) with mushrooms, bok choy with garlic sauce, fried veggie dumplings-they were all so delicious! I put tons of the spicy sauce on everything which improved it even more. The dumplings were the best I've had in Europe-small and flavorful with crispy bottoms-try them with the vinegar sauce.

The gluten cakes were really delicious and got better the more I had. The mushrooms were really good. I could have eaten two of those dishes.

Strangely, the worst things we had were the noodles-4 people had them at my table and 3 reported their soup/fried noodles were bland. The noodles themselves were good but the dishes they were in were overall ok.  I would recommend getting lots of the small dishes or vegetable dishes, my meal was perfect but those who got the noodles and not appetizers were a bit disappointed.

Would definitely go back though! The staff were also extremely nice."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,5,2015-08-24,"Cozy little place that serves real Chinese food: we tried the beef noodle soup, fried eggplants w pork wrapped inside, and beef w/ broccoli. All tasted super! & the boss is super nice!!"
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,4,2014-12-25,"Totally hit the spot. Everyone was so nice and accommodating especially since we are beginner German speakers. I'm Chinese and everything we had was very authentic tasting. Very reasonably priced and delicious. Both my kids loved their food as well. We had 3 different types of noodle soups. We tried duck, beef, and pork belly...all were very good. Also the pan fried pork dumplings were excellent. Easy walk from our hotel on Augsburg Str. Large menu with many choices. Highly recommend."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,4,2014-08-22,"Very tasty, and they have the soup-filled dumplings I've been looking for!  Handful of tables in Wilmersdorf, but a nice, clean eating area -- a big step up from your standard Asia Box, with competitive prices.  Menu is split between dim sum-style starters and various noodle dishes, stir fries, and soups.  The house-made noodles were packed full of gluten-y yumminess, and the dumplings were fresh and tender.  Will definitely make this a regular stop when we're looking for Chinese food."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,3,2014-10-22,I agree that their dumplings are good. But I can't agree that their soups are all that great. Was a little disappointed frankly especially after reading all the great reviews here.
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,5,2015-04-17,"Exceptional food, friendly people, highly recommended.

Fish flavour aubergine is so good."
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,5,2014-10-04,As a New Yorker who missed Chinese food - god damnit this food is good. Happy to find it in Berlin. Wide selection with excellent prices - will be back.
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,4,2014-08-31,Nice food with reasonable price. I tried noodle soup and I thought it was soy sauce based soup. it was not but ok. I want to try more noodle menus next time.
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,5,2014-01-04,"A very good Chinese cafe-restaurant! And I a surprise to eat the ""black dumpling"" there as a special dish, you might call and ask if any before you are there. Full of fun dinner night out to chat with boss there :)"
shanius-house-of-noodles-berlin,5,2015-01-15,"Hi,I've visited that restaurant a couple of times, so here is my text:
The restaurant is a bit hidden but not far from the metro station (4 min walk max.). The place is not so big (25 prsons max.), so you have to wait if all tables are full (which happens between 7 and 9pm), but during the afternoon there is always place.
The service is nice, very friendly, so i asked and they suggested nice dishes to try:
The entrees were tasty. I was happy to find real Kimchi and Edabame. There are also exotic things like marinated pig ears and marinated chicken legs, which were tasty too.
The meals I have tried are the fried stuffed Eggplant with beef (frittierte Auberginen mit hackfleisch). Is a kind of sweet meal, but it tastes amazing. I tried it twice.
Another day i had a dish with Pork and nuts. Dont remember the name (it was another recommendation from them), and again the flavor was great and the portion was good too. 
Then i tried some pork belly dish, which was delicious also. All with prices around 6 euro. Not that bad!
Recently i tried the noodle soup with beef. It was good too. The noodles were thick enough, like those that are handmade, and not overcooked. Its flavor was also very good but mild, so i asked for some chili ;-)
The drinks i have had there were beer (cold and tasty), tea (jasmin, flower tea) and cola. Prices are normal.
I also tried the fried dumplings after i heard they were handmade by the owner. 
They were very tasty too but you need more than a dozen if you have a real big hunger.

So, the dishes at the restaurant are in my opinion very tasty (sehr lecker). Nice student friendly price. Sehr empfehlenswert.
Chinese friends also found it yummi (so that they go there very often now).
All the best"
china-restaurant-huating-berlin,5,2010-10-26,"So, after wandering about the Soviet-inspired city-planning horror that is Karl Marx Allee, I was hungry and needed a good meal... and on a cold and rainy Saturday, with the streets almost empty, I ventured into this welcoming spot.

Unexpectedly, a menu in English appeared, the owner was more than accommodating in getting me a glass of water (with ICE!) they he didn't bill me for! The build out is top notch - comfortable and decorous, without being schmaltzy like some asian places.

I ordered a sublime sweet and sour chicken - a meal that was simply perfect in so many ways.... and, honestly, a portion I should hav shared with someone else, but greedily ate most of it. Nice touch: The plate is served on a small pedestal that holds a candle to keep it warm as you dine. It looks great and actually works.

For many cities, this place would probably get 4 stars, but here in Berlin - they get 5 for the extras."
china-restaurant-huating-berlin,4,2017-05-24,"First off, loved all the fish tanks that this restaurant had. The food was very good and filling. The portion sizes were really good for the price. I went with some friends so we were able to pick and choose a ton of dishes and split everything. Worked out to be a high quality dinner that also gave each of us a variety of food."
china-restaurant-huating-berlin,5,2015-05-23,Nice restaurant. Good service nice portions of food would  definitely go there again. Best chinese i have had in berlin
royal-garden-berlin,5,2016-04-27,"I was looking for some nice place for nice buffet in Berlin, this one pop up. So I decided to pick weekend come here to have a try. The Royal Garden is a bit far from the city center. luckily, they are not so far from the S-Bahn station. It takes about 10 minutes to get to this place from the station on foot. For me, was 30 minutes around got to this place. My firest impression this place after I walked in. I really like how the restuarant looks like. It just got this very traditional and cultural of China in. the nice decoration just made the atmosphere of the whole place even better. It was very classy at the same time. The place was quite full when I was here, well, probably because it was weekend. That was the reason, I have called them before and made a reservation. It didn't take long, to find the table. And the staff come to us really fast. I did find it a bit funny that they only brought us one menu, when we gotlike 10 people. Anyway, we just came for the buffet, so it wasn't a big deal. I check thier cocktails menu and tried the drink. the price of the drinks were alright. the taste was of the cocktail Zombie I ordered was fine.

About the buffet, they just looked amazing. one side was the food which already cooked and the other side was the food that not cook yet which people allowed that choose the way they wanted to be done. And the cold dishes like sushi and vergatables. They offered quite a lot options and good one. I found most of the food tasted great. I was so full after couple dishes. They also got an Icecream machine, which to be honest, I didn't really like the icecream. it just full of water and tasted just alright. I also didn't find watermelon at the fruit section. it was kind pity. 

At the end, I do think it is worth to come here to have a nice meal, even this place wasn't that close to city center. I think, for a big group of people will be a great choice, so everyone could find something they could eat."
royal-garden-berlin,4,2016-04-25,"In a word - massive buffet, strange attitude, far away... But yummy.

Longer version (for the brave) - I'll be honest, you'll never find me in this part of town unless there's a special occasion, and there was! A bday of a fellow yelper (and a friend) is a reason for a feast.

I was first to arrive, and the staff looked at me and examined me constantly which made me feel uncomfortable, but when everybody else joined it was okay 
The place itself was crowded and every table was full, the minute somebody left, another group came almost instantly 

We ordered some cocktails and headed over to the Buffett, and that's exactly what I have in mind when I hear this word.
Thing is massive! 

For 18€ there's an endless option all you can Buffett - from simple salads to many grill options, you can make a mix grilled diy plate (choose from seafood, fish, beef, lamb, chicken and even kangaroo!)  or you can take some from the rodizio grill.
And if that's not enough there are plenty of other main dishes- I've tried a little from almost everything, curry, different Chinese dishes, fried rice, regular rice, soups and deep fried fruits.
Dessert? No worries! There's soft ice cream and various cakes to choose from! 

I wasn't expecting much from a place outside of town, but the quality of the food was very good! Everything I tried tasted fresh and there's a reason why I had four plates ;) 

If you are around and starving, I'd pass by"
royal-garden-berlin,3,2013-10-19,"My companion and I went here for dinner the other night. There was supposed to be another companion, but she canceled at the last minute. Anyway, the two of us went to the southern part of the city to check this place out. I heard good things, and I was willing to try something new.

Anyway, I was surprised at this Chinese restaurant. It is huge. There is a huge statue at the door way. There is a floor aquarium with carp swimming. There is a chariot right at the middle of the room. It was all quite theatrical.

Oh well, we weren't there for theatre, but we were there for the food. I was about to order something from the menu, but it seems that everyone here goes for the buffet. I am not typically a fan of buffets, wanting more quality than quantity, but when in Rome...

So I went. I started with the soup. The soup was good. There were two choices, but I tried just the sour and spicy one. I also tried several dishes, and they even have a grill, where you pick up the meat you want, and put it on the counter for the person to grill it for you. It was all very elaborate. 

Anyway, the buffet costs 15,90 EUR plus drinks. Again, I rarely go to buffets, and I felt like a plump overfed pig afterwards. I have to say, the buffet choices were good. But with quantity, sometimes, it overshadows the quality. There are too many things to get your attention, which then makes it hard to determine whether what you ate really was special or not. 

I probably won't go to a buffet again for the next year, as this restaurant filled my buffet quota. Three stars, it was A-OK, but I'd rather go somewhere cheaper, and more special, and more intimate. While a buffet is a good way to sample what a restaurant offers, I'd go for quality over quantity any time."
royal-garden-berlin,5,2016-08-06,"Perfect Asian buffet, the shrimps is to die for and so are the Mongolian bbq................................................................
Strongly recommended"
royal-garden-berlin,4,2014-03-28,"Wild choices of yummy food from south east asia.
With an open Wok grill, where you can choose your ingredients.

The fairly priced open buffet, is ""balanced"" with rather expensive drinks.....

The staff is super friendly, and the food quality is great....the location is in the middle of no where, and would make sense only if you have access to a car."
royal-garden-berlin,3,2015-02-22,"Near where I live, but definitely not my favor. not original enough, more or less like german style chinese food; many people went there, buffet have a lot of Asian things. Stuff are nice."
selig-berlin,5,2017-06-10,"Prima!! 
One of the best Chinese restaurants in Berlin!
The waitresses were very nice too.
We loved it!"
selig-berlin,3,2016-02-11,"More like 3.5 stars but I think this place is a pretty decent chinese restaurant with great service and nice ambience

The place is smaller than I thought and there might be a bit of a wait if you go there during peak hours. 

Food was decent. 
The spicy chicken was a bit too small with too many peppers and not so much chicken yet the Portion is generous. The 四季豆 was weird. Not really like what I have in china or the US. Mapo tofu was on point but lacks wow factor

super friendly service and Free rice/tap water :)

-1 stars for not honoring yelp offer and for having a lot of promos/campaigns yet servers seem to know nothing about those and the campaigns themselves are ambiguous"
selig-berlin,3,2016-02-11,"Although I'm Vietnamese, I lived in Beijing this past summer and had a decent share of Chinese food. Disclaimer: I've never been that fond of it.

I've had better. That being said, this place was still good and reasonably priced. Vegetarian options available, service is friendly, and they speak Mandarin. And if it matters to you, many if not most customers were Chinese.

I did dock a star for not explaining/acknowledging the check-in offer."
selig-berlin,4,2015-02-26,"A nice Chinese in the west of town, came here with a friend that is a regular and likes this place and he was a bit surprised to see that the menu and inteior design has changed.

The place as it is now looks a bit depressing, he said it was more authentic before. 
Now the walls are painted in a grey-ish brown tone with what seems to be some old traditional drawing on the wall.

The staff was very kind and the place was full of people.
The menu was packed with good things but because I wasn't too hungry I just had vegetarian noodles with fried tofu and could even barely finish - it's a very hearty dish with homemade noodles and lots of veggies! 

On our table there was a little wooded ducky with our chopsticks on it - loved it!

For starters we got a complimentary cucumber and seaweed salad.
Still can't understand how such a simple thing can be so wonderful, we tried to figure out what's in it for a little while - so sesame seeds, fresh chilis, garlic, soy sauce, little pieces of seaweed and probably some other stuff we couldn't figure out.
This was a highlight.

To sum it all up.. A nice place with good food, I'll come back to check out some more dishes :)"
selig-berlin,5,2014-06-05,"A friend suggested an impromptu lunch and fancied something Asian, so I had to leave my comfort zone and venture out of Schöneberg!  It had been a while since I was at Selig, which specialises  in Hunan, Sichuan and Lanzhou cuisine so for a brief moment I thought they had changed hands, the interior was completely different, where was the Aquarium, would I get my dumplings or hand pulled beef noodles? 

Turns out Selig had just upped its game and gone all funky. Newly refurbished; actually it's still ongoing Daniel was just mounting up some of the old pictures to hang on the new walls. The toilets are all modern and tiled with Mah-jong pieces, very trendy! I really liked the alcove at the back made up of Abacuses or should one call them Abaci Who knows! 

I had gone there intentionally for some homemade Jiaozi and Lanzhou Salad or perhaps a bowl of beef noodles. But the new décor steered me off course and I ended up having something else instead. They say everything happens for a reason and rightly so as I left feeling a whole lot more Asian than when I went in (I recently took a survey to determine my subconscious true nationality, the outcome was German.)!

Anyway, shortly after we ordered our drinks we were presented with a complimentary appetiser of cucumber dressed in a slightly spicy sesame sauce. Amazes me how something so simple can taste so good.  We perused the menu and settled on #012 Frühlingsente (crispy fried duck with Lanzhou salad and a peanut sauce), #013 Fritiert Tintenfish (deep fried salt and pepper squid) and #162 Dir Rauber von Hunan (Hunan spicy fried beef) .

The Lanzhou salad that came with the duck was how I remembered it. I just love the taste and textures, all mingled together in a delicious and slightly spicy dressing.  The Spicy beef was delicious, packed with fresh green chillies, garlic shoots, red peppers and coriander. It was fragrant and had a nice dry heat.  

My only disappointment was the squid. I expected pieces of fried squid in a salt and pepper coating but it was actually more like battered calamari rings, without the salt and pepper, having said that it was really tender. I soon got over it as Daniel the manager had added a complimentary fish dish to our surprise. This was really, really good and off menu, Carp in a chilli sauce, a speciality from his province. Seriously, the fish just melted into your mouth and the sauce was to die for!  I was quite happy just to have the sauce with the rice it was that good. 

My lunch companion said the Chinese food here made a very good impression on him; Chinese is not usually his first choice when it comes to Asian food in Berlin. Something I tend to agree with!

The whole meal including a beer and a pot of green tea came to about €27. 
Will come back again soon for my Jiaozi fix, or maybe I will have the beef noodles mmm... Watch this space!"
selig-berlin,1,2017-01-17,"Disappointing food for rather high prices. 
The atmosphere is dingy with the distinct lingering smell of bathroom, which already made me lose my appetite. 

The food was overall quite greasy, which is a character of bad Chinese food. The Szechuan fish we ordered tasted like old frozen fish, very stale and slimy in texture. 

Overall sanitation of the space was turnoff to my wanting to eat anything there. Would not recommend especially given the price of usually 20-35 a person."
selig-berlin,5,2013-10-20,"My companion took me here for dinner one night. I am not a big fan of Chinese food, but he said I might change my mind after this one, so we ventured into Charlottenburg for this little restaurant.

As I was browsing the menu, I noticed that they specialize in Lanzhou cuisine: this already earns them 1 star, as I'd rather go to a place that has a narrow specialization and does it well, than a place that has a wide specialization and does everything mediocre. China is a huge country, and I'd rather go to a restaurant that would introduce me to a more specific type of cuisine.

The second and third star is for its food quality. They seem to have a lot of noodle-based dishes (maybe it's a Lanzhou thing, I don't know), but everything we ordered was fabulous. My companion is a vegetarian, but the things we ordered tasted something I didn't expect for vegetarian food. Glass noodles, deep-fried crunchy tofu, that was mind-blowing. 

The fourth star is for the ambiance and atmosphere. It was clean, funky, modern, but at the same time, also rather traditional. I like the juxtaposition of the old Chinese-style furniture with the pop-art interior design. 

The fifth and final star is for the fact that as much as I would like to find something bad, I cannot. Maybe their restrooms need a little bit of remodeling, but I am so willing to overlook that since their food is just delicious, and cheap too. Their entrees average around 8 EUR, and 12 EUR is high-end already. 

Needless to say, I am definitely going back here. This is good Lanzhou cooking; it gets full points from me."
selig-berlin,5,2016-06-16,"A friend from Yunnan took me here with a group of friends. It was by far the best Chinese food I had in a restaurant in Germany!! Order their Sichuan and Yunnan stuff. It was soo flavorful and spicy and perfect! This is as authentic as it gets among the legions of sad Vietnamese ""China Thai Sushi Imbiss""....."
selig-berlin,4,2015-04-09,"I'm Chinese and I think I am in a good place to say whether this restaurant is authentic.

Well it is. I could go there days in a row.

I definitely have a Northern's taste./They have good spicy stuffs./ They have original decorations (check the toilettes for ex)

Just sometimes I wonder what the waitresses are doing because they keep ignoring people......They are lovely girls though, whenever I get the oppotunity to talk to them....."
selig-berlin,4,2016-05-19,"We loved it! Went there ysterday and had a fun time with great food. The chicken curry was especially delicious! A little bit on the spicier side though ;) waitresses are sweet, too."
selig-berlin,3,2010-04-17,"Popular Chinese restaurant with a nice selection of open wines from around the world for 3,90 a glass. All kinds of guests - from families to a company that planned a trip to China. And then of course the incredibly sweet gay couple in love.


 Duck lovers will probably love this place, since there's a variety of dishes on that theme. I'm a seafood fan myself, so I had the ""Selig Plate"" of assorted seafood for 9,50 euro - served with rice or noodles.


 The seafood quality was good, but like all Chinese food, my dish wasn't really hot. We asked for some extra chili on the side to spice it up a bit."
hot-spot-berlin,4,2013-07-30,"First time!

Great lunch menu, fantastic food!

Biggest choice of wine I have ever seen in an Asian restaurant."
hot-spot-berlin,4,2016-09-09,this is an excellent chinese place that uses no MSG and features a huge selection of german wine.  they were featured in the nytimes http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/world/europe/10berlin.html?_r=0 for their wine selection.  the food is very tasty.  my personal favorites are the duck with tea leaves and the spicy wontons.  some of the dishes are really spicey!
lon-men-berlin,5,2015-06-10,"The best Chinese restaurant in Berlin #not just ""one of""#

Tried 4 dishes, loved all of them!
Wu xi pai gu (ribs)
Handmade fish ball soup
Shui Zhu yu (spicy fish)
Xiang chao ya (duck)

For people who want to taste really Chinese food, this is the place."
lon-men-berlin,5,2008-08-04,"Of course, the most-important point of all is the food itself: I found it quite good. It was well-seasoned and obviously fresh (including the sauce.) This seems to be a well established family restaurant which may be in its third or fourth generation. The rice was also a better jasmine variety than the norm--these small details can really add to the meal.


 The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite nice in that earlier Chinese tradition, where the interior is quite ornate and the tables are actually vitrines with ornate woodwork inside, covered by glass. I can imagine this would be a great place to take a larger party to, or for a special family outing.


 The service was also quite good.


 All in all, I would have to rate my experience there as very good."
asia-deli-berlin,5,2017-10-17,"Now this doesn't look like much from the outside, but it has really good quality tasting Chinese food.  I brought my friend who lived in China for 5 years here, and he said it was the first time in a long while he's had a flashback of his days in China while eating the food.   On a side note, the waitress was very friendly."
asia-deli-berlin,3,2015-10-26,"It doesn't look like that but this place serves pretty authentic chinese dishes BUT MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RED MENU CARD NOT THE PAPER ONE. I REPEAT RED!!

Because that's where the good stuff is.

I have been here twice one time I made the mistake and didn't followed the instruction and just ordered what was on the boards. (The food was meh)
After asking a fellow foodie I found out what to do:
You go inside and act as of you are fully aware of how this shit works like really confident and SIT DOWN. Don't go to the desks. May be don't smile. Just be very confident. If you look cool enough they'll bring you the red menu and you scored. This time the food was nice although I accidently ordered something with meat. The menu is totally random and has no specific order. But remember: You are aware of all that!

I had the pak choi with steamed egg (filled with meat as I found out) and hacao (which are filled with chicken and shrimps instead of shrimps only). Was still good.

Staff is ... Well it feels like this place is the god damn Berghain among cheap Asian venues. They don't smile and are not friendly but not rude either. It's weird."
asia-deli-berlin,5,2017-02-11,"This is straight-up some of the best Chinese food in Berlin. The outside can be severely misleading and the staff barely speaks German, which pays homage to the authenticity of the joint. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves tasty Chinese food!"
asia-deli-berlin,4,2016-11-04,"One of the best tasting Chinese restaurants I've been to. Do not let the ""Imbiss""-style store front scare you off, this place is awesome. Make sure you get the red menu, that's where the great food is and go for all the specialities."
asia-deli-berlin,2,2014-03-31,"Based on the reviews, I tried this place the other day. I also felt much better when I walked in and there were a number of Chinese people eating there... I ordered a beef with peanut sauce dish. It was just okay, I've experienced  much better but the price was about 5€..."
asia-deli-berlin,4,2011-07-27,"This place doesn't look like much outside or inside but it's actually really good. Great price and good taste.
The old chef was a real master, some of the best Chinese food I ever had, but sadly moved back to China in 2010, the new chefs are getting better all the time though, not quite up to the old standard yet
Choose from the menu, not the set plates on the board, much better food."
the-tree-berlin-3,5,2017-08-11,Their noodles are honestly one of the best things I have ever eaten. The flavors are earthy and sophisticated and the food is super fresh and a lot is made daily like the noodles and broth. The food here has a great mix of textures and flavors that come together perfectly. Their desserts are super amazing too - not too sweet and also very aromatic. Seriously you will not be disappointed!
the-tree-berlin-3,5,2017-03-10,"This is an amazing place for fans of genuine Chinese (Sichuan) food. Taste and authenticity is the focal point here, and the staff's love for food shines through in all dishes. The ""Ahorn"" noodle dish is recommended!"
the-tree-berlin-3,5,2017-06-15,"Probably the best food all along the Brunnenstr. Had tried soups and noodles dishes, and they are all great. It's possible to discover up to 10 different flavors inside a simple baked potato. One of my favorites recently."
the-tree-berlin-3,5,2016-12-09,The noodles are spectacular. One of the best new additions to the Berlin food scene.
the-tree-berlin-3,5,2017-02-26,"Elegant, charming ambience. Cozy, intimate and full of beauty. The owners are super nice, make you feel right at home. And the food, oh the food is spectacular! I've been here four times already and it has been consistently good. Just the right balance of flavor, spice and home cooked goodness. Just delicious!"
the-tree-berlin-3,3,2016-12-08,"Peaceful ambience. Organic concept. The corner booth cubicals are an enriched idealism that in reality is quite uncomfortable; ambitious cross-leggers may suit these tables. Plating technique was beautiful but heavily lacked in flavor and depth. Service was very kind however, and as it is a new Restaurant it would surely evolve into something spectaular in the future."
tangs-kantine-berlin,5,2014-11-12,"I have been looking for good Chinese food in Berlin and after reading the reviews here I decided to give it a try. 
Great ambiance and beautiful lighting, even live music (mellow classical guitar). 
Started out with the hot and sour soup and it was fantastic, never thought it would be possible to find it in this town. Next up was the good old standard Gung Bao Chicken which was equally delicious. It took only 5 mins for the soup to arrive and my main dish was brought after I finished the soup (kudos for that). 
Very friendly staff and the menu is even fun to read, lots of information about different dishes and the regions they come from and Chinese culture. As mentioned in previous posts the prices are a little on the steep side (9.80 Euros for the Gung Bao) but it was well worth it. Quality ingredients and the best Chinese food I have had in Berlin so far. I will definitely come back to try more."
tangs-kantine-berlin,2,2015-09-17,"Definitely not amazed by this place. 
I used to eat a lot in the chinese neighborhood when I was living in Paris so sometimes I am missing good chinese food, so I was quite excited to try this chinese place. I wasn't sure if I should stay or take away but the place was very busy so I eventually decided to take away. 
I sat a few minutes to choose what I would be taking and I ordered some pork ribs with a black beans and soya sprouts sauce. I waited quite a while (between 20 and 30 minutes) for my food so I had the time to figure out I wouldn't like the atmosphere of the restaurant anyway : the place is pretty nice at first sight but you soon realize that's it's actually very noisy, and the staff is kind of sulking  and constantly in a rush. 
When I got home I realized that a part of my food had leaked in the bag thanks to a broken plate. Anyway, the portion was very big even tho it was containing mostly sauce. The food itself wasn't very tasty, I couldn't judge their whole cuisine with only one dish of course, but I really didn't enjoy mine that much."
tangs-kantine-berlin,2,2016-05-31,"as much as I'd like to give this place a higher review due to the pleasant nature of the staff and owners- I cannot. 

the location rocks, but the food can't possibly be less flavorful and less interesting. 

brown salty sauce on every dish is the best characteristic I can give to describe the eating experience. 
blah blah bland.

with all the other Asian options in the hood that at least contain flavor, this is hardly enticing. 

I miss Chinese food :("
tangs-kantine-berlin,4,2016-02-23,"Slightly more expensive than your average asian restaurant around the corner, but very well worth the money, big portions of real authentic food. Great service, friendly staff and interesting dishes. My favourites, the fried dim sum and the pig dreaming of the sea. The fire dragon (lamb) is also worth trying."
tangs-kantine-berlin,1,2015-11-10,"Don't even dare to go to this restaurant, cause you will puke right away from the dishes. The food and the poor service are nothing but an impertinence. We (2 people) paid 30€ and received disgusting rubbish! I thought I'd finally found a nice chinese restaurant, but I got disappointed all the way."
tangs-kantine-berlin,5,2015-10-17,Nice little restaurant with great food and lovely staff. Favourite Chinese place outside China ;)
tangs-kantine-berlin,4,2015-09-28,"Very nice evening, food was good and sitting outside was perfect"
tangs-kantine-berlin,3,2013-12-09,A nice place for the neighborhood. The food was pretty good with the dumplings being the highlight of the meal. I also really liked how the menu told you facts about Chinese culture and how it related to the food. The only thing that keeps this place from having more stars is the timing on the food. It took over 40 minutes for our first dish to come out. The rest followed in a painfully slow trickle and by the end we were more ready for our bill and to leave than waiting for anymore of our food. If they could work on that then the food would be worth its price.
tangs-kantine-berlin,2,2011-04-18,"I consider this restaurant, after a dinner consumed, smoke in the eyes.
Nice service, amazing lighting and furniture, cozy and good musical background.
ALl amazing features, but when it comes to Duck...well, food is quite disappointing and definitly overpriced.
Would never go back."
tangs-kantine-berlin,5,2012-02-14,"I loved this place . The wontons in soup were amazingly handmade tasting, great flavors. The main dish was so good I took some home.  They had some interesting choices and spicy flavors for Berlin. The service was perfect."
tangs-kantine-berlin,4,2009-07-25,"Fine chinese food in a modern ambience. They have 5-6 varieties of Dim Sum (3-5 pieces for 3 Euro). I tried 4 different types and liked the non-vegetarian ones made with weath flour better than the ones with rice flour (more sticky less taste). The Dim Sum is served with a authentic soy vinegar sauce which is not everyone's taste. But the crispy duck was really delicous, juicy meat and crispy skin with fresh vegetables in a very savoury dark sauce but with 10 Euro a bit pricey for the region."
tangs-kantine-berlin,5,2012-03-22,"Oh wow, I thought I would never find real Chinese food in Berlin! In fact, I swore it off just in the same way I swore off eating Mexican food in Berlin. I gave this place a try with my friend who also has high expectations for authentic Chinese food. We had the duck (I think it is called Donald Duck) and it was absolutely delicious. We have been back since and even tried to go last week, but it was closed on a Thurs. night. Strange. I am so relieved that I don't have to wait until I travel out of Berlin to eat good Chinese food again!"
china-restaurant-fu-long-berlin,4,2015-07-24,"Great food! Really nice staff, the waitress gave my boyfriend and I free fortified wine at the end.

One thing- yelp says it is 4 euro signs when it is SO CHEAP! Like, 5 euros for an entree and a side cheap. Please change this yelp!"
china-restaurant-fu-long-berlin,4,2015-07-24,"This is the place for good Chinese food at low prices. They even gave us the lunch special price at dinnertime, and complimentary after-dinner drinks. Knocked my socks off. I would say to you: go for it. Go. Tasty stuff."
toca-rouge-berlin,5,2012-07-17,"This place was recommended by the place we're staying and it was an excellent recommendation.  It is more of a fusion place than a traditional Asian resturant.  So while in yelp it is called ""Chinese"" you won't be finding mapo tofu or other traditional things or even bad western-fied things.

The dishes all have creative names and interesting references.  They should have a contest about them!  There are yummy starters like the pumpkin soup with shrimp (The shrimp are amazing by the way). Or fried dumplings (they call them dim sum, but don't expect and carts here,) on what appears to be either melted ice cream or yogurt.  Something bizarre that shouldn't be good but is!  I also tried the seven minutes of pleasure, which is almost large enough for a main, that evokes memories pleasant memories and good taste sensations.

The mains are also just as creative and interesting.  Like spicy chicken with Szechuan pepper.  While it doesn't have a lot of that lovely/deadly/numbing ingredient it is there, so points for them.  The beef with sweet potato is amazing as well as the shrimp dish whose name I can't remember.  but it is served with a mango and tomato side that is very well done.  All the mains we've tried are creative and cooked perfectly with good skill.  

A tip, get the ""best"" house wine, it is a very nice tempranillo and priced nicely.  the service is attentive and friendly.  Small, so get there early.  

Really, I feel this place is four and  half stars, but the disco bathroom buts it over the top!!!"
toca-rouge-berlin,3,2015-09-06,"Very artisticly decorated place probably great for small eats and drinking. Dishes are created with thoughts and named impressively and associated with Chinese artists: CHUNG KING EXPRESS, named after the same movie, WANTEN WITH CHICKEN AND PRAWNS SERVED IN HOT SOUP.  GONGLI´S BOAT (named after internationally renowned movie star巩俐) it's FRIED DIM SUM WITH PRAWNS AND CORIANDER CREAM. And MULAN MILAN VERSUS SHE-RIMP. So you get the idea

The interesting appetizer I ordered was  DEEP THROAT AVOCADO: KING PRAWNS WITH AVOCADO ON RICECAKE WITH MAYONNAISE AND WASABI. The visual delivery is fine.  However the favor doesn't come up to the uniqueness of the ingredient choice. It's a bit dry due to the rice cake,  even the moisture from avocado and wasabi paste didn't help. 

Overall, the food is not bad. They are trying hard.  I may go back again to try BRUCE LEE,  OX CHEEKS SALAT IN FINE STRIPES WITH APPLE CUCUMBER AND THICKNESS VINEGAR MARINADE. Or just have a drink in their trendy dining lounge."
toca-rouge-berlin,2,2016-04-30,"Went to Toca Rouge for the first time today.

food gets 3 stars.
Service gets 2 stars at most. Stressed out with no reason (the place was empty as we came in) 

The place where they have so much customers through tourists that they just dont care if ppl are feeling welcome at all. 

And after paying the bill you only leave tip coz ""you kind of have to"" and go out disapointed"
toca-rouge-berlin,3,2014-07-01,"I expected chinese food.its not at all.... ordered pekingduck,pumpkin soup,something lip(sichuan spicy), lamb something. Taste is not bad not good. 

Its fusion food that  taste ok.
Pumpkin soup was good. 
Peking duck roll was soso. 
Main dishes was all soso. 

Maybe i expected too much.. 
I love chinese food and i lived about 10 years there.
And if this restaurant is in china. Will close very soon.
But maybe good taste for german.

But my.germam friend said:
Good atmosphere, nice price, good starter
Soso maindish."
toca-rouge-berlin,3,2014-03-22,"It may have been the positive reviews that raised my expectations, but I found the whole experience to be pretty average.

I arrived on a Wednesday night and it was packed, elbow to elbow. I don't really mind that (I'm pretty used to small spaces and quite a lot of chatter around me). This is just a note to the people thinking of dining here, that regardless of the day of the week, you may or may not get a table unless you have a reservation.

The service here is okay. Nothing spectacular, and there was a bit of a mix-up where a beer my friend ordered went to the table next to us, but hey, things happen.

I guess the thing that just left me bored was the food. The rice cake soup (Green White Pool) we ordered was kind of bland and salty. My pork entree with the goji berries (Yasming Dynasty) was okay. The mango salsa that it came with was tasty but the pork was a bit too chewy and the goji berries didn't actually enhance the flavor as much as I wish it had. My friend's fish (Mao's Darling) was also bland but somehow compensated by the salty sauce. I wish it was a bit more balanced. The dessert (Sticky Orange Love Pudding) was good but I felt could be recreated at home after a trip to the Asian supermarket.

I did enjoy the disco lights and the random hip hop playing in the bathroom though. 

Overall, nothing wrong with this establishment. If I do end up going back sometime, I'll try some of the other dishes and see how they are. It just wasn't a wow experience for me."
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2014-08-02,"Toca Rouge is classy.
The restaurant is intimate with its dark decor, stylish, the food is well presented, and the pricing is perfect for what you get. I always order the same thing when I go - The Red Honey Blonde I think it is called. It is a beef and sweet potatoes dish. I am in love with this dish. My girlfriends ordered an array of appetizers and they were all delic.! The only thing they could work on is the staff. The waitresses could smile or be a bit more engaging. I find myself returning again and again to Toca Rouge since it is delic., fresh, flavorful, unique, and a great place to meet up with a very small group of friends or have a romantic dinner."
toca-rouge-berlin,5,2015-08-03,Came here after we couldn't get a table next door. W. O. W. It was amazingly good. Such interesting flavours. Must return to try more of the menu. We had the beef with sweet potato which was my favourite and the duck. Terrific Riesling as well.
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2015-10-20,Very special atmosphere and delicious food. I have been here a couple of times and never got disappointed. The service is good and attentive. I would not recommend this place to big groups as it is a small restaurant. Group of four is good though. Loved the banana dessert cake.
toca-rouge-berlin,3,2014-06-19,"Meh. 

This place is a gimmick, from the decor, through the dish names and all the way to the toilet. 

The food itself was decent, nothing special. Reasonably priced, but they seem to be repeating themselves with different dishes having the same sidings and garnish. 

The mood is very modernish and hip, but as far as eating goes, you'd enjoy one of the simpler Vietnamese places in Mitte much better."
toca-rouge-berlin,5,2011-09-04,"In coming to a foreign land, even one as close to the UK as Germany, you kind of feel a bit stupid for going to the kind of restaurant you'd get at home. We ummed and ahhed over the idea of getting Chinese food in Berlin, wondering, what *is* the German view on this type of cuisine? How will it taste? Are we running a risk?

Pah! One look at the menu which resembles the opening credits of the Star Wars movies and we were convinced this was the right place to eat. And I can safely say this was like no Chinese food we'd ever experienced before. An ice cold Tsingtao and a plate of veggie dumplings, steamed pak choi and sticky rice, consumed alfresco on a balmy Berlin evening... I was happy indeed. The sauce was fragrant, the pak choi not soggy in the slightest and the dumplings themselves were tender, crisp around the edges and packed to the rafters with greens and fresh delicious veg. This felt wholesome and indulgent at the same time, and that's not an easy combo to achieve.

Unfortunately, we didn't do what we were supposed to do and check out the disco bathroom with its unnerving and entertaining flashing coloured lights. I can't believe we forgot about that! Oh well, looks like another trip over to Germany's in order then..."
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2013-07-14,"Nice! 
Funny menu w/ Asian fusion dishes. They combine traditional cooking w/ new and surprising ideas and fresh herbs.
Go there, but make a reservation. It's always crowded!
And: don't forgot to visit the restroom before you leave ;-)"
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2012-11-30,"Great food for fair prices. I had the green soup and the black  honey hot girl beef on sweet potatoes. Delicious. I loved the interior design. Make sure to go and have a look at the bathroom. ;)

Downside: no WiFi."
toca-rouge-berlin,1,2014-07-21,We left. Horrible. It was a hot day and i wanted some tap/drinking water. They said i could not have any. They required i buy bottled mineral water. No. Bad service.
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2012-10-24,"Great atmosphere, good food and fairly priced. Highly recommended if you're in Mitte area."
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2014-02-02,"very stylish restaurant, with good kitchen, 

cheap rates. high celebrity tight;-), 

in the summer sitting i did sit outside, in front of the restaurant, somehow really nice. 

unfortunately, the restaurant is not huge, so it's good to have a reservation"
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2013-03-04,"A hip little Asian fusion restaurant and interesting variations on Asian dishes. My favorite item on the menu is Bailing's Lips which is a spicy chicken and vegetable rice dish. The dim sum appetizer is also a favorite item that I order when ever I go there. The young wait staff is excellent and attentive. My only complaints about the place is that it can be noisy and the seating is often a little cramped. The little wooden stools that everyone sits on aren't that comfortable and are always falling over when people rise from their seats. But all things considered,  I really like this place and go there often. The decor is very dark and the lighting is intimate in a modern way. As many others have said check out the bathroom. You won't regret it."
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2013-04-12,"I finally made it. I have been wanting to go here for some time! I never new that they were open for lunch, so when I found out, I took my chance. The lunch dishes are all around €7 and the portions are pretty big. Looking at the menu, the staff seems to have a healthy sense of humor, always appreciated :D The food was served quickly and was delicious. The only reason I am subtracting a star is because the food is quite greasy, but good! Go!"
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2013-04-02,"I really liked my dinner here. I'd walk or take a short ride on public transit to eat here again. I ordered a vegetarian ""un-duck-cover"" dish which was very flavorful, a little sweet, a little sour, but not greasy. The prices were not high, but the value was not exceptionally good, as the portion size was not very large. The low light and funky decor created a kind of nightclub atmosphere.
English menu and English-speaking staff."
toca-rouge-berlin,5,2009-10-04,"Best asian food I had so far in Berlin. The names of the meals are fancy, and the dishes are excellent. Modern Asian dishes, very tasty.
The design is simple, but stylish, the open kitchen allows you to see how your food is prepared and the staff is super friendly."
toca-rouge-berlin,2,2012-11-22,"Den Begeisterungsstürmen auf Qype folgend haben wir kürzlich das Toca Rouge getestet, aber meine Bewertung fällt etwas bescheidener aus.
Ja, die Einrichtung ist hip und cool. Alles in schwarz und ziemlich dunkel, jeder Tisch hat nur eine längliche Taschenlampe als Spotlightbeleuchtung  sicherlich Geschmackssache, aber ich fand's ganz gut. Dennoch stehen die Tische seeeehr eng beieinander, sodass ich fast bei meinem (fremden) Nachbarn auf dem Schoß saß. Die Bänke an der Wand sehen bequem aus, sind aber kein bisschen gepolstert, daher bin ich nach 1-2 Stunden ziemlich verspannt wieder aufgestanden.
Die Bedienung ist freundlich, manchmal sogar eher etwas zu zurückhaltend, und die Karte (4-5 ausgedruckte DIN-A4-Seiten, die zusammengetackert wurden  ist wohl auch hip) tatsächlich etwas abgegriffen.
Ich entschied mich für Hühnchen in Orangensoße mit Wasserspinat und natürlich Reis. Die Hühnchenstreifen waren wirklich lecker paniert, allerdings hätte man für 8.90 Euro auch besseres Fleisch verwenden können! Ich musste leider ein paar Knorpel oder fettige Stellen aussortieren  sehr ärgerlich und auch anstrengend während des Essens, wenn man nicht weiß, ob der nächste Bissen gut werden würde. Die Soße war ganz gut, der Reis auch. Der Wasserspinat machte allerdings eher einen Anschein von Pok Choi, war sehr schwierig zu kauen und blieb dauernd unangenehm im Hals stecken.
Für das Geld und den Hype hätte ich mehr erwartet  schade!"
toca-rouge-berlin,5,2009-01-30,"Ah wow!


 When I came here I thought I love living in a big cool city - that has stuff like this.


 Excellent food, funky interior. Nice other guests.


 Do not wear a mini (I didn't I promise) - the seats are of plastic (aka desigenr plastic) so you might get stuck on the seats.


 Great wine with creative pan-asian dishes.


 Super describing names for the dishes - I had a Red and Black Girl I think it was great - and relatively cheap as well.


 I'll become a regular here."
toca-rouge-berlin,2,2013-05-21,"We found this completely overhyped. Appetizers were more or less interesting, but not overwhelming. Main course, boring boring boring  pan seared dried minute turkey stake does not justify the price and the fancy name of the dish. Frankly, the dinner was a disappointment. Nice interior design, but please, pay more attention to the food!"
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2009-10-21,"Cool place, great food and well presented. Despite it being lunch time, the service was excellent. Well recommended!"
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2010-01-17,"Creative chinese cuisine, served in a hip room. The prices are low and the service is good. You can't ask for much more!"
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2009-07-22,"Asian Fusion at its finest.
Waiters quick and friendly .
Price and quality of the food is spot-on
Theres only one way to make this place better: Expand and get more seating. Way to often have i wanted to eat here and had to wait 10-30 mins for a seat. But its always worth the wait."
toca-rouge-berlin,5,2011-12-28,"Cool interior, yummy food. Will definitely come again."
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2009-03-04,Our favourite little Asian-fusion place. Affordable. Simple. Fresh!
toca-rouge-berlin,5,2009-01-03,"Ate there and loved the Asian fusion food theme. Had the evening special called 'Cow Boy' which was beef strips, asparagus, sweet potatoes, spicy Asian sauce atop a rice cup - very yummy. The main course and a Tsingtao beer was only 9,40EUR."
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2008-12-12,It's good for Berlin and the service is exceptional for this part of the world. The food is a kind of Asian fusion with a Cantonese edge and the dishes have kung-fu movie style names. I've been there many times for lunch and always had a good meal.
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2008-11-25,"Great place with a fun vibe. Very young crowd. Asian food, mostly Chinese I believe. The food was great. Light dishes which tasted great. I had a clear soup to start off followed by the catfish which was really good. Drinks were well mixed, the Chinese beer was good and the place has a bit of a celebrity factor. I'd reserve a table as this place seems to be really in at the moment and was packed when we were there on a Monday night. Highly recommend checking this location out if the style of food is your thing."
toca-rouge-berlin,4,2009-04-18,"Nice place, with an open kitchen - always nice to see your food being prepared. Interesting menu, with a nice range of asian fusion cooking - i tried the honey beef with sweetpotato and noodles, which was great and a little different from the usual run of the mill. I'll definately return."
toca-rouge-berlin,5,2008-08-21,Fresh Asian food with a menu away from your ordinary Chinese restaurant. Bargain food for around 10 Euros. Very friendly service. Only a step away from Scheunenviertel with nice bars for a quick drink after dinner. Asian 'Cantine' style à la Wagamama in London or Monsieur Vuong in Berlin. Highly recommended for a quick bite at lunch or dinner.
mayflower-berlin,5,2014-07-24,"Truly authentic, fresh and beautifully tasty Chinese food.

The eggplant is really good. Nice authentic Chinese food and great service. Oh, and you can get hot pot too! Just call ahead to book it :)"
mayflower-berlin,3,2017-02-26,"I tried a soup and the vegetarian dumplings - nothing to write home about, but the service was ok and nice."
mayflower-berlin,5,2016-04-07,"Excellent and authentic! This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berlin. It's probably my favorite Chinese restaurant outside of China or Los Angeles. It is so good. I recommend the pork soup dumplings, pork belly, beef tripe, and jellyfish and cucumber. It's fun for me to read the menu in Chinese and German when my primary language is English. The wait staff speak it all so be comfortable ordering. I hope this restaurant stays in business forever. Perhaps they can open up a location in West Berlin too."
mayflower-berlin,2,2016-11-01,"I don't like given Chinese restaurants bad reviews since I'm Chinese myself, but this place does not deserve 4.5 stars.  First of all they serve jasmine rice instead of traditional sticky rice. Also, the dumplings and tofu were the cheaper store bought kind.  I don't expect homemade tofu everywhere, but at least spend the extra 20 cents and buy the silken tofu for your mapo tofu.  I will say the waiter was very friendly and the restaurant is clean."
mayflower-berlin,2,2016-06-08,"The food is nothing special at all. I guess the right word would be ""edible"". So, no reason to go. Also, that waitress sure was awkward and not very good."
mayflower-berlin,5,2016-11-04,"Our group of four had an excellent meal here last week. Service was fine (by Berlin standards) and, more important, the menu was varied and the food tasted great--the spicy dishes were actually spicy (and not Germanized into blandness). We had the Qualle (quail egg) appetizer, Aubergine appetizer, and the boneless chicken in Szechuan chili oil sauce to start--all very good. For main courses, we had Gongbao chicken, lamb with coriander, and the pork belly (favorite of Chairman Mao, supposedly). All very tasty."
mayflower-berlin,5,2016-08-02,This restaurant deserves more recognition. Very good food at decent price. Huge menu.
mayflower-berlin,1,2016-04-02,"The only reason I've given this restaurant 1 star is because the food is good. I'm not going to go into detail but if there's more than 2 people in the restaurant, don't bother. You could be waiting hours for your food. More attention is given to take-aways than guests VERY patiently waiting hours. And I do mean HOURS! Never again!!!!

UPDATE!!
Went there again! The restaurant looked pretty quiet so we went in to give it another chance. 
The food was typically good and there were 'TWO' pleasant waitresses BUT, as we waited and waited for our food, numerous take-out customers came in to collect food and at one point, most of the customers were Deliveroo and Foodora deliverers. Is this the way restaurants are going?
We were getting to the point of 'where's our food!!!' when it arrived. 

The Mayflower should downsize to being a take-away restaurant and save on rental space. It clearly gives take-out customers preference. Seriously. That WAS the last time!"
mayflower-berlin,1,2016-07-20,"This was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. The hot and sour soup was as sweet as ice cream, stank of vinegar and it was not spicy(hot) at all. The Gongbau chicken was mostly tiny bits of chicken and cabbage swimming in a sickening red-orange gloppy sauce, with perhaps three peanuts. It was not spicy. While Berlin can be a difficult city for Chinese cuisine, there are much, much better options. The owners should be ashamed: this is of such a low standard I can't comprehend how you could knowingly serve this food to customers. While I can see some other Yelpers have liked it, I wonder what their standards might be..."
mayflower-berlin,5,2015-06-10,Most amazing Chinese restaurant with the best Sichuan cuisine I've experienced so far in Berlin!
the-flying-monkey-berlin,5,2017-11-04,"It's difficult to find a good dimsum place in Berlin. Not only are they usually pricy, but they're also not as tasty as what you'd find in the US or UK (outside of China of course).

This little jem is a great find. They really meant it when they say hausgemacht, they're true to their word: fresh homemade dimsum! It took a bit of time to get our meals, but it was worth the wait; it's also how you know they're actually made fresh. And the cost is reasonable (I wouldn't say cheap - it's Europe after all).

We had just the basics: har gaw, siu mai, and char siu bao - just a quick stop. We're definitely coming back to try the other items."
the-flying-monkey-berlin,5,2017-08-13,"One of the best Asian cuisines we have ever been to. We ordered family style and nothing remained on the table at the end. Highly recommend this place, our first real stop in Berlin! The location is in a great area, much happening here."
green-flavor-berlin,5,2017-05-31,Good service and even better food. I had the wontons in chili oil to start. And then the noodles with pork and shrimp and vegetables. Was fantastic.
little-tibet-berlin,5,2017-06-01,"Extremely pleased! Great food, friendly service, really happy customer. Did I say great food? Really great food!"
little-tibet-berlin,4,2016-09-26,"There probably aren't many cuisines you can't find in Berlin, but I was still surprised to see a Tibetan restaurant. Warm and cozy, decorated with candles and photos of Tibet, Little Tibet serves staples such as momos (dumplings), noodle soups, rice dishes, and a few wok-fried meats. 

Torn between the shaptak shoko (stir-fried beef, veggies, and potato) and a mixed momo dish, the momos won out. Six steamed and six fried dumplings (three each of minced beef & ginger/spinach & cheese) served with a light salad in a yogurt dressing and a sweet chili based dipping sauce. The momos were surprisingly light but did not skimp on the filling.

 It made for a satisfying (and, at €8, quite cheap) meal."
little-tibet-berlin,5,2017-05-10,Very tasty!  I had a veggie dish off the house specialty page and it was great!  Service was very friendly and attentive too. She also spoke English in case you don't speak German.
little-tibet-berlin,5,2015-06-12,"In a word - a great place which offers a lot of options from all over Asia, with some traditional Tibetan dishes.

Longer version (for the brave) - we arrived to this place after literally trying every option of Asian food there is, besides Tibetan. It was time.

So we sat outside as the weather was nice and ordered vegetarian starters (Tsa pakora and veggie fried pockets).
Watch out, as it is served HOT! got a burn from the spinach :) 
But it was delicious, and quite a big dish for a starter, each of them came with two dips too. 
I loved the Tsa pakora, it was crispy and had great flavors. 

For the main dish I had a traditional Tibetan dish, sorry but I forgot its name... Seasoned rice with veggies and beef with some cashews on top and an interesting curry sauce, it tastes a bit different than other curries I have tried before and it's not too spicy for those of you who can't handle it, no worries :)

My friend had fried momos with cheese and spinach, I'd like to try them next time but with some meat inside, got a feeling it would taste much much better! 

The dishes are very big, I was kinda full half way through but it was so good I kept digging in it almost until I finished it all!

Service was great and we had a great experience, the prices are really good and overall we just had great fun, no doubt I'll come again soon! 
All the reviews here really justify everything about this place, hopefully mine does too :)"
little-tibet-berlin,5,2015-04-18,"A companion of mine suggested that we head here for dinner before heading to the theatre yesterday. She was positively impressed before and since I haven't been to a Tibetan restaurant in a long time I opted to go here as well. 

We ordered the spinach fritters for an appetizer, and I followed that with the mixed momos for a main dish. The spinach fritters were good, paired well with the sauce they had, and the mixed momos I had were also very tasty. I thought that the momos would be too bready, but actually they were more filling than bread, which was a plus. 

We also ordered the mango lassi.

It seems that this place is popular; we came there around 6:30 PM on a Saturday and we got tables, but there were plenty of other tables that were reserved, and an hour later when we were leaving, there were already plenty of tables that were occupied. Make a reservation if you want to eat later."
little-tibet-berlin,3,2016-04-22,Not really authentic Tibetan food but nontheless it was tasty and the dishes came quickly.
little-tibet-berlin,4,2015-08-11,Awful service but delicious food. Really great ginger tea with actual ginger in it. Delicious :)
little-tibet-berlin,4,2015-07-03,"Good food and prices. A little oily. Had the beef and onion dumplings and a chicken fried rice with cashews and a delicious orange sauce, which was apparently a monks' recipe. My favorite was the potato pancake appetizer. The food was very good, but I couldn't finish, as it was very rich. Cheap vino"
little-tibet-berlin,4,2015-03-21,Relaxing joint with plenty of space and lots of options. If you're getting momos then prepare to wait awhile because they take time to prepare. We got the spring rolls which I wasn't too fond of but the vegetarian momos and beef momos were fantastic. Will definitely consider coming back.
little-tibet-berlin,5,2015-02-14,"It was a surprise place for us. We've seen it from outside and went in because I love Tibetan Buddhists. It's quite spiritual inside. A White Tara shrine welcomes you, there is photographs from Tibet and words and pics of Dalai Lama on walls. It's the first time I see Buddha in some place as more than plain decoration.

Surprise part was the food. We started with some Tibetan pastry and salad, continue with large plate of mixed dumplings and duck with red curry. If we didn't had trouble breathing with all those foods we could go on until morning. All of them were great.

Staff is super friendly, atmosphere is peaceful. And don't worry even though a Buddhist place there is lots of meat and alcohol =)"
little-tibet-berlin,5,2014-05-16,The food was really good and the staff was very friendly. The prices were low for the quality of the food!
little-tibet-berlin,4,2013-11-17,"So they could do something better with the lighting inside but the food was great!
They have a nice but not too big variety of dishes and delicious appetizers.
I'll go again and can recommend it!"
little-tibet-berlin,5,2012-03-02,Super lecker!!! Geh mal wieder!
little-tibet-berlin,4,2012-05-09,"Of the cluster of Himalayan-themed restaurants around Western Kreuzberg, Little Tibet is both the best and, apparently, the only one run by actual Tibetans. For the first indication of their authenticity, be sure to order the Butter Tea, a frothy, salty, buttery traditional brew that is somewhere between a beverage and a soup on the western palate.
Tibetan food is not known for its showiness or intense flavors, but it is ideally suited for a cold winter night, and the dishes here are reliably hearty and satisfying. The standout, of course, is Momos, housemade Tibetan dumplings (steamed or fried) which are easily the best in town. A combination platter is great value and a meal unto itself, although a dipping sauce other than the default sweet-chili condiment would be an improvement. 
Meat and vegetable dishes here don't veer far from the path trod by many of Berlin's Asian restaurants, with Tibetan specialties fighting for attention with more Thai and Indian-influenced fare. There's nothing wrong with the fried duck or coconut soups, but they do rather dilute the concept. Still, they're a notch above nearby competitors; nothing comes off as greasy, and the vegetables are uniformly fresh and tasty.
Service is also reliably friendly and fast, and the very cheap wine list makes it very easy to have a nice evening out here for under EUR20 p/p."
little-tibet-berlin,4,2011-06-13,"I'd never eaten Tibetan food before, so I don't know if it was authentic, but it was delicious. I got the selection of momos, and enjoyed all the flavors. The spinach pakoras were great, as were the sauces that came with them!"
little-tibet-berlin,3,2010-11-07,"I was excited to eat at a Tibetan restaurant, and much of the food itself did not disappoint. The restaurant was full on a Friday night, which is always a good sign, and the ambience was lovely, including the charming transparent salt-bricks used in constructing the bar. The food was both familiar in sharing some qualities with north Indian cuisine, but it also had a style of its own. I enjoyed the chicken pakoras and found them light and accompanied by a mild sweet chili sauce and a yoghurt sauce - perfect as an appetizer. The timing and the service, however, was disappointing. People have told me that time flows differently in Tibet, and based on our service, I'm now more than ever convinced this is true. Our waiter did not give us our appetizers all at once, which left me in the uncomfortable position of having to decide whether to eat in front of my hungry friends, or let my food get cold, or, to divide up what I had among us. The waiter continued to be inattentive to the point where we all found him rude, despite his smiling face, and even after we sought him out to ask for the check, he continued to serve other tables for several minutes. We ended up being late for a concert because of this bad timing, which left us all unsatisfied. While we were waiting for the check I noticed scores of dirty glasses and plates that had piled up on the bar over the course of the evening (and not going back into the kitchen) which made me wonder about hygiene, while I also wondered if they were perhaps short staffed, or if this was their normal mode of operation. My momos (dumplings) were tasty, but I was left a little hungry afterward and would have gladly eaten a meal with a bit more on my plate.


 Perhaps it is in my good nature to give this restaurant another try, since I like the idea of Tibetan food, and much of the atmosphere was pleasant. I wonder if the poor service itself was an exception, and that uncertainty is enough to give it a second chance, but only in a situation where I have nowhere else to be after my meal."
royal-garden-berlin,5,2016-04-27,"I was looking for some nice place for nice buffet in Berlin, this one pop up. So I decided to pick weekend come here to have a try. The Royal Garden is a bit far from the city center. luckily, they are not so far from the S-Bahn station. It takes about 10 minutes to get to this place from the station on foot. For me, was 30 minutes around got to this place. My firest impression this place after I walked in. I really like how the restuarant looks like. It just got this very traditional and cultural of China in. the nice decoration just made the atmosphere of the whole place even better. It was very classy at the same time. The place was quite full when I was here, well, probably because it was weekend. That was the reason, I have called them before and made a reservation. It didn't take long, to find the table. And the staff come to us really fast. I did find it a bit funny that they only brought us one menu, when we gotlike 10 people. Anyway, we just came for the buffet, so it wasn't a big deal. I check thier cocktails menu and tried the drink. the price of the drinks were alright. the taste was of the cocktail Zombie I ordered was fine.

About the buffet, they just looked amazing. one side was the food which already cooked and the other side was the food that not cook yet which people allowed that choose the way they wanted to be done. And the cold dishes like sushi and vergatables. They offered quite a lot options and good one. I found most of the food tasted great. I was so full after couple dishes. They also got an Icecream machine, which to be honest, I didn't really like the icecream. it just full of water and tasted just alright. I also didn't find watermelon at the fruit section. it was kind pity. 

At the end, I do think it is worth to come here to have a nice meal, even this place wasn't that close to city center. I think, for a big group of people will be a great choice, so everyone could find something they could eat."
royal-garden-berlin,4,2016-04-25,"In a word - massive buffet, strange attitude, far away... But yummy.

Longer version (for the brave) - I'll be honest, you'll never find me in this part of town unless there's a special occasion, and there was! A bday of a fellow yelper (and a friend) is a reason for a feast.

I was first to arrive, and the staff looked at me and examined me constantly which made me feel uncomfortable, but when everybody else joined it was okay 
The place itself was crowded and every table was full, the minute somebody left, another group came almost instantly 

We ordered some cocktails and headed over to the Buffett, and that's exactly what I have in mind when I hear this word.
Thing is massive! 

For 18€ there's an endless option all you can Buffett - from simple salads to many grill options, you can make a mix grilled diy plate (choose from seafood, fish, beef, lamb, chicken and even kangaroo!)  or you can take some from the rodizio grill.
And if that's not enough there are plenty of other main dishes- I've tried a little from almost everything, curry, different Chinese dishes, fried rice, regular rice, soups and deep fried fruits.
Dessert? No worries! There's soft ice cream and various cakes to choose from! 

I wasn't expecting much from a place outside of town, but the quality of the food was very good! Everything I tried tasted fresh and there's a reason why I had four plates ;) 

If you are around and starving, I'd pass by"
royal-garden-berlin,3,2013-10-19,"My companion and I went here for dinner the other night. There was supposed to be another companion, but she canceled at the last minute. Anyway, the two of us went to the southern part of the city to check this place out. I heard good things, and I was willing to try something new.

Anyway, I was surprised at this Chinese restaurant. It is huge. There is a huge statue at the door way. There is a floor aquarium with carp swimming. There is a chariot right at the middle of the room. It was all quite theatrical.

Oh well, we weren't there for theatre, but we were there for the food. I was about to order something from the menu, but it seems that everyone here goes for the buffet. I am not typically a fan of buffets, wanting more quality than quantity, but when in Rome...

So I went. I started with the soup. The soup was good. There were two choices, but I tried just the sour and spicy one. I also tried several dishes, and they even have a grill, where you pick up the meat you want, and put it on the counter for the person to grill it for you. It was all very elaborate. 

Anyway, the buffet costs 15,90 EUR plus drinks. Again, I rarely go to buffets, and I felt like a plump overfed pig afterwards. I have to say, the buffet choices were good. But with quantity, sometimes, it overshadows the quality. There are too many things to get your attention, which then makes it hard to determine whether what you ate really was special or not. 

I probably won't go to a buffet again for the next year, as this restaurant filled my buffet quota. Three stars, it was A-OK, but I'd rather go somewhere cheaper, and more special, and more intimate. While a buffet is a good way to sample what a restaurant offers, I'd go for quality over quantity any time."
royal-garden-berlin,5,2016-08-06,"Perfect Asian buffet, the shrimps is to die for and so are the Mongolian bbq................................................................
Strongly recommended"
royal-garden-berlin,4,2014-03-28,"Wild choices of yummy food from south east asia.
With an open Wok grill, where you can choose your ingredients.

The fairly priced open buffet, is ""balanced"" with rather expensive drinks.....

The staff is super friendly, and the food quality is great....the location is in the middle of no where, and would make sense only if you have access to a car."
royal-garden-berlin,3,2015-02-22,"Near where I live, but definitely not my favor. not original enough, more or less like german style chinese food; many people went there, buffet have a lot of Asian things. Stuff are nice."
xinh-xinh-berlin,4,2010-07-24,"When I asked my German teacher - who had taught German in Vietnam for a year - to recommend authentic Vietnamese food establishments in the city this was his first recommendation. Not sure if that is really the best Berlin has to offer, but it made me feel good as I had been eating lunch here for over a year on the advice of a friend. 

This is an Imbiss and really only suitable for lunch or take-out, but the food is tasty, the ingredients fresh, and tastes closer to what you would expect in Asia than many of the Germanified Asian Imbisses in the city. 

TIP: During the week from about 12.30-1.30 this place is very busy as it services the lunchtime worker crowd. If you want to avoid long delays on food avoid these times if possible.

TIP 2: The chocolate factory opposite is excellent for desert!

Bottom-line: Surprisingly good solid Vietnamese Imbiss."
xinh-xinh-berlin,5,2017-01-06,"If you want to have a very authentic Vietnamese food without any show off, just visit this friendly sweet place, probably one of the best in Berlin."
xinh-xinh-berlin,4,2015-05-15,Inexpensive food on the go or to eat in! Their sommer rollen are super delicious and come with a dipping sauce. Their glasnudeln are also pretty cheap and delicious and if you think Germans do things not spivey - you gotta try this Vietnamese food. Family run (I think) and very friendly!
xinh-xinh-berlin,4,2015-11-12,"Nice place and good food to choose from :)! Can be busy around lunch time, and it's a pretty small place. But when the weather is good, you can also sit outside :)!"
xinh-xinh-berlin,5,2014-07-17,"Being a big fan of Vietnamese, it was a joy finding this place off the beaten path in Berlin.  The food was fresh, delicious and reasonably priced.  I had a tofu dish that was out of this world and the chicken with a mango sauce was so light and refreshing."
xinh-xinh-berlin,5,2015-10-12,This little Viet Streetfood shop sells what I consider the most authentic Vietnam streetfood to take away. It is fast and yummy and I feel great after a bowl of soup number six with chicken and hot spices as well as coreandre and lime :-) I love this place!!
xinh-xinh-berlin,5,2014-11-27,"God I love this little place. Since I've found it, it has been the saviour to my hungry belly many a lunchtime! I think half of the people in my company come here at lunch to be honest, it's usually pretty packed out. It's super quick service, huge portion sizes, loads of fresh veggies and great value, which is really all you want at lunch. I find the curry sauce wonderfully spiced, and they have the all important bottles of sriracha for the extra kick if you need. Definitely one of go-to places for a quick satisfying bite at lunch. Bear in mind that it is more of fast food type joint, seating is limited, in October you could still sit outside, not so sure now though..."
xinh-xinh-berlin,5,2015-10-13,"This is a great unassuming place in a kind of touristy area. The price is right, and the service is great. The soup with coconut milk is a great way to beat the cold during the Berlin winters!"
xinh-xinh-berlin,4,2012-11-04,"The best Vietnamese street food in Berlin, fresh, wonderfully spiced and cheap. The Pho Hanoi is my favorite item on the menu but the rice dishes are pretty good too. This is many a take-out joint but there a couple of tables inside and out and a small counter where you can sit in the window and watch the world go by."
xinh-xinh-berlin,4,2010-09-06,"I put this place up on skype bur somehow the wrong address was added! The right address is Linien strasse 136, 10115. I come here about once a week and get rice noodles with tofu. Super fast food, only 2 people that work here. A woman that has 2 tiny butterfly clips in her head and never smiles, which I actually find reassuring bec they are all business and no play! Really cheap food but quite tasty. Extremely fresh. It gets very busy at lunch though as everything is made on order."

Still highly recommend it!!!"
xinh-xinh-berlin,4,2010-06-13,"healthy, inexpensive and delicious, fresh vietnamese spring rolls are main attraction in this tiny joint. The other dishes are average.

aroma-berlin-2,4,2016-04-27,"I have been wordering for awhile since I moved here, if there a cantonese restaurant around. Somehow I managed to find this way and gave it a try. It sure brought back some memories to me with their food. The food I ordered was most common thing you could get back in Hongkong or Guangdong area back in China. I also tired some dim Sums there, it teasted good. I think there are something people should try when they get here. There are some other thing on the menu I haven't even heard, but it seems could be tasty.

The restaurant's location wasn't so difficult to find me for me. but it did took me quite some time from the Bahnhof Zoologischer Garten. There are many other Asian shops or restaurant around the place, cool to walk around. espically if you try to get something special from Asia. The price was alright, the staff were also friendly when I was there. I think, it is quite cool place to try out some cantonese food."
aroma-berlin-2,3,2016-02-15,"Might be one of the most authentic dimsum places in Berlin... A huge variety of cantonese food/dimsum. 

The bbq pork was not that good and tasted weird and they didn't have egg yolk custard bun which is kind of sad. The pork bun was ok and most dimsums item like shrimp dumpling (hagaw) shumai (pork dumpling) and lomaigai (sticky rice in lotus leaf) and cheungfan were on point. 

We waited for almost an hour for food :( and the service was pretty bad ... So i dare say that this place is so damn authentic ... With so damn authentic chinese-style service, on par with the service you would get in China lol

A bit pricey (we paid like €17) :( but we left super fulllll"
aroma-berlin-2,1,2016-02-24,"Their food is fine, but that's about the only thing nice about them. Their atmosphere and service are HORRIBLE. The restaurant looks unclean and their decoration needs to be told it's the 21st century already. 

But most importantly, every single employee at this restaurant need to get a reality check, so they can finally understand that they are not the kings and queens of this world. I have no idea why they are so snobby since they have almost nothing to offer. 

I have been polite and friendly like any other guest would at a restaurant, but all they have shown me is disrespect. Don't open a restaurant if you don't like servicing people! 

Visiting their restaurant has certainly ruined my mood for the rest of the day."
aroma-berlin-2,4,2015-09-04,"Tried roasted pork belly, fried tofu skin roll with pork meat inside, stir fried beef with vegetables and black bean, stir fried rice noodles with beef, and black bean pork spare ribs there.. And I would recommend fried tofu skin roll and roasted pork belly!! They were good!! The dim sum spare ribs was just okay, but the bones were too big and the meat were so thin.."
aroma-berlin-2,4,2013-03-13,"* Atmosphere was nice, on the classier end (family lunch/dinner, not student grunge).
* Only tried the dim sum: enjoyed it all, but the Reisblätterrollen mit Schweinfleisch really hit the spot.  Sesame balls were alright, but then again, coming from the SF area, I have high standards for these kinds of things.
* Moderate price range: 9-15 euro dishes, dim sum was all around 3.50 per portion
* Service relatively friendly and quick, but also a bit disorganized: we ordered four different dishes, three of which came in a timely manner, and the fourth of which we had to remind them about.  The sesame balls came third, so what we considered our dessert was semi-awkwardly in the middle.

OVERALL
I'd recommend coming here if you want a moderately upscale Chinese food.  Great for large groups, though you'd probably want to make a reservation.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to make it back again, but possibly to eat more of the pork rice rolls..."

aroma-berlin-2,4,2015-09-02,"Best dim sum in Berlin, hands down. It's on the traditional end of things, not all modern fusion like Yumcha. Great menu with almost all of the basics covered and then some. Just missing Xiao long bao. I'd consider doing some unspeakable acts for one (or twelve) of those right now. Highly recommend the black bean spare ribs (forogt the actual menu item name but yeah), but don't let them take the sauce away when you're done. Dip your char siu bao in it. YES. Service is great! Fast and super friendly. Great sense of humor too."
aroma-berlin-2,3,2013-11-30,"Not really a ""dim sum"" place per se. Sure, one can order (relatively expensive) dim sum dishes, but that's just it--you must order and wait up to 20 minutes to get it.

This IS NOT a proper dim sum restaurant.  (a place that seats 200+ with servers that continually push carts around the tables. You get a slip of paper and as a cart comes by with something that looks good, you wave, the food is delivered, and your paper is stamped.) 

I miss real dim-sum where I can get a full table of food within minutes of sitting down. Dim-sum food is designed to be on a cart for a little while. When it's fresh made-I don't know, it's missing something. It needs to sit in steam for a bit to get the magic.

I've been here a couple of times and while they have all the dishes (even chicken feet), it's not the experience I was looking for. It's just not right.

Unfortunately, in Berlin I think it's the only option. What a sad, sad thing. :("
aroma-berlin-2,4,2016-04-10,"Pretty good dim sum at reasonable prices, very friendly and polite staff."
aroma-berlin-2,4,2010-01-15,"As a half chinese person growing up in sweden, I'm incredible grateful for Aroma. The restaurant has a classic look to it. It's clean with BIG tables so you can bring all your friends. You can get Hong Kong styled food which isn't possible in a whole lot of European countries.


 This is the place to go to have dim sum. The food is decent. I don't care if it's home made or not. I'm just happy to be able to order sweet pork bun and eat Chinese breakfast at all.


 I've brought Chinese friends there and my mom, and they all liked it! The waiters are saints compared to e.g Good Friends. The service is good. They speak English, Cantonese and German.


 The menus are in Chinese, English and Russian and perhaps Thai. I don't remember.


 You won't be impressed if you come from London. London has by far the best Chinese food in Europe, but it's also much more expensive. The rest of Europe don't usually serve traditional Chinese food so this is the closest you can get to a decent Chinese breakfast in Berlin. The wan tan soups tastes great and they don't overcook it as every other Chinese restaurant in Berlin.


 They open at 12 so it's perfect to go there and relax and eat dim sum for a couple of hours. I love this place because it's the best Chinese restaurant in Berlin.


 I must warn you that some dumplings might be a little bigger than you're used to."
aroma-berlin-2,5,2014-05-29,Phenomenal food and outstanding service. Large portions filled us up and the staff couldn't have been friendlier to foreigners. Great place!
aroma-berlin-2,3,2010-01-02,"This is a tolerable Chinese restaurant - nothing fancy, especially not the food. But they have the widest selection of 'home-made' dimsum in Berlin although I would dispute that claim as only a few dishes might not have come from some frozen supermarket packs. Still, this place is better at dimsum than Good Friends down the road, so it does not say much for dimsum in Berlin in general.


 The other dishes are also adequate but not nearly as good as they should be, although I am very discerning when it comes to Chinese food, so perhaps I am being a little too stringent here.


 Atmosphere is nothing special, but service is quite fast and friendly and if you must have Chinese dimsum in Berlin, then this is where you can get your fix."
aroma-berlin-2,4,2009-09-04,This place doesn't look like much but actually is the best place to get Dim Sum in Berlin.
